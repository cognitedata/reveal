import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

`@cognite/reveal` supports point clouds through a third-party library, [`three-loader`](https://github.com/pnext/three-loader) that is
included in the Reveal codebase and modified for our needs. Most of the internal point cloud logic is based on [`potree`](https://github.com/potree/potree/).
The viewer supports loading both point clouds and CAD models at the same time. Point clouds can be generated from various sources including
[laser scans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_scanning) and [photogrammetry models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry).
Loading point clouds is done with identical code to when [loading CAD models](./cad-basic) - Reveal will determine that the model
is a point cloud model and act accordingly.

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/versioned_docs/version-4.x/components/DemoWrapper';

<DemoWrapper modelType="pointcloud" />

```jsx
import { CogniteClient } from '@cognite/sdk';
import { Cognite3DViewer } from '@cognite/reveal';

const loginManager = new LoginManager('publicdata', 'api');
const client = new CogniteClient({
  appId: 'myPointCloudAppId',
  project: loginManager.project,
  getToken: async () => loginManager.getToken()
});

// some div in your html page for Cognite3DViewer to insert a canvas
const domElement = document.getElementById('canvas-wrapper');

async function main() {
  // to view models from CDF authentication is required

  await client.authenticate();

  const viewer = new Cognite3DViewer({ sdk: client, domElement });

    // load a model and add it on 3d scene
    // https://publicdata.fusion.cognite.com/publicdata/3d-models/5564365369975452/revisions/2817572261344477
    const model = await viewer.addModel({
      modelId: 5564365369975452,
      revisionId: 2817572261344477,
    });
    viewer.loadCameraFromModel(model);

    // call viewer.dispose() when you don't need the viewer anymore
  }
  main();
```

## Point size

You can use `pointSize` property to set the size of each rendered point in a point cloud model.

```js runnable-4x
model.pointSize = 0.1;
```

## Point budget

The point budget limits the number of points loaded and rendered at any given time,
which helps to adapt performance requirements to the capabilities of different hardware.
Recommended values are between 500.000 and 10.000.000. The budget is shared among all
loaded point clouds.

```js runnable-4x
viewer.pointCloudBudget = { numberOfPoints: 500000 };
```

## Point shape

You can set the point shape of each rendered point in the point cloud. Values are defined by `PointShape` enum.

```js runnable-4x
// import { PointShape } from '@cognite/reveal';
model.pointShape = PointShape.Square;
```

## Point color type

You can specify in which way points should be colored. Values are defined by `PointColorType` enum.

```js runnable-4x
// import { PointColorType } from '@cognite/reveal'
model.pointColorType = PointColorType.Depth;
```

Other useful coloring schemes are `Rgb` (color) , `Classification` (color by point class) and `Intensity`
(strength of the backscattered signal in a laser scan).

## Hide model

Models can be temporarily hidden using `CognitePointCloudModel.visible`.
The viewer must be explicitly re-rendered after setting the visibility flag:

```js runnable-4x
model.visible = false;
viewer.requestRedraw();

setTimeout(() => {
  model.visible = true;
  viewer.requestRedraw();
}, 5000);
```

## Point cloud post processing effects

### Point blending

Users can enable the "point blending" effect
which produces a more "stable" rendering of surfaces within the point cloud model, but it comes with a cost of
decreased performance.

<a target='_blank' href={useBaseUrl('/img/point-blending.jpg')}>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/point-blending.jpg')} alt="Illustration of point blending effect" />
</a>

You can enable the described effect by passing a corresponding property on initialization of `Cognite3DViewer`:
```jsx
const viewer = new Cognite3DViewer(
  {
    sdk: client,
    pointCloudEffects: {
      pointBlending: true
    }
  });
```

### Eye-Dome Lighting

Eye-Dome Lighting (EDL) is enabled by default. It draws an outline along edges in the point cloud, making it easier to distinguish objects and features visually. It has a small performance impact.

<a target='_blank' href={useBaseUrl('/img/pointcloud-edl.png')}>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/pointcloud-edl.png')} alt="Illustration of the Eye-Dome Lighting (EDL) effect. Left image is rendered without EDL, the right one is rendered with EDL, which is the default case." />
</a>

You may disable EDL by passing `'disabled'` as the value for `edlOptions` in `pointCloudEffects`:

```js
const viewer = new Cognite3DViewer(
  {
    sdk: client,
    pointCloudEffects: {
      edlOptions: 'disabled'
    }
  });
```

You may also alter the `radius` and the `strength` parameters of the effect. Any of these may be left unspecified, in which case they will be given a default value:


```js
const viewer = new Cognite3DViewer(
  {
    sdk: client,
    pointCloudEffects: {
      edlOptions: { radius: 2.2, strength: 0.5 }
    }
  });
```

## Classification filtering

Some point clouds have classification information associated with each point.  This can
be used for coloring or to filter the point cloud.

:::note
The demonstration model doesn't have classification data so the examples below are not
runnable.
:::

To list classes available in a point cloud model, use `CognitePointCloudModel.getClasses`:

```js
const classes = model.getClasses();
for (const pointClass of classes) {
  console.log(pointClass); // Prints a numeric class code
}
```

It's also possible to check if a model has a given class by using `CognitePointCloudModel.hasClass`.
A list of well-known point class codes are defined in `WellKnownAsprsPointClassCodes`. These definitions
by the [ASPRS LAS 1.4 specifications](http://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/LAS_1_4_r14.pdf).

To filter away certain classes, use `CognitePointCloudModel.setClassVisible`:

```js
model.setClassVisible(WellKnownAsprsPointClassCodes.Ground, false);
```

To check if a class currently is visible, use `isClassVisible`:

```js
const visible = model.isClassVisible(WellKnownAsprsPointClassCodes.Ground);
```

## Unloading models

Point clouds (and CAD models) can be unloaded using `Cognite3DViewer.removeModel()`:

```js runnable-4x
viewer.removeModel(model)
```
