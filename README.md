# Tenant Selector

This repository houses the tenant selector which sits in front of Cognite applications.
This tenant selector is responsible only for selecting a Cognite project (or application tenant) and then redirecting to that application. This also includes handling the OIDC and other auth flows.

More information can be found in the [design doc].
