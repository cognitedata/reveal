Anti-aliasing is a technique to reduce the aliasing effects in the rendered result, and improves visual quality.

Reveal supports several anti-aliasing modes:
- [Fast approximate anti-aliasing (FXAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_approximate_anti-aliasing) - a fast 
technique that reduces anti-aliasing at modest cost.
- [Multi-sample anti-antialiasing (MSAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing) - hardware supported
supersampling technique. This produces high-quality anti-aliasing at some performance cost depending on how many samples
is taken per output pixel. Reveal supports 4, 8 or 16 samples. This mode is only supported on WebGL 2 (currently this 
means desktop computers, most Android devices, but not iOS - see [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/webgl2)).
- MSAA + FXAA - a combination of both modes where an FXAA pass is performed after the MSAA pass.
- Disabled - no anti-aliasing.

By default [Fast approximate anti-aliasing (FXAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_approximate_anti-aliasing) is used.
This mode works on both WebGL 1 and WebGL 2. If WebGL 2 isn't supported, FXAA is used as a fallback.


```jsx
const viewer = new Cognite3DViewer(
  { 
    sdk: client, 
    antiAliasingHint: 'msaa4+fxaa' 
  });
```

Modes currently supported are `'disabled'`, `'fxaa'`, `'msaa2+fxaa'`, `'msaa4+fxaa'`, `'msaa8+fxaa'`, `'msaa16+fxaa'`,
`'msaa2'`, `'msaa4'`, `'msaa8'` and `'msaa16'`.

:::note
The examples in this documentation use `msaa4+fxaa`.
