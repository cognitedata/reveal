### Install wasm-pack

##### Windows

##### Linux / macOS

You can either run the same command as in Windows, or install it faster through https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/

## Getting started ##

To test the viewer, you need to build the viewer first and then the examples:

```
cd viewer
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

cd examples
npm install
npm run serve
