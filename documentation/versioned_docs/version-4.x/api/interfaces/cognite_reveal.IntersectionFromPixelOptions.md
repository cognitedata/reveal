[@cognite/reveal](../modules/cognite_reveal.md).IntersectionFromPixelOptions

Options to control how [getIntersectionFromPixel](../classes/cognite_reveal.Cognite3DViewer.md#getintersectionfrompixel) behaves.

**`Deprecated`**

Since 3.1 these options have no effect.

## Properties

### pointIntersectionThreshold

â€¢ `Optional` **pointIntersectionThreshold**: `number`

Threshold (in meters) for how close a point must be an intersection
ray for it to be considered an intersection for point clouds. Defaults
to 0.05.

**`Deprecated`**

Since 3.1, threshold doesn't affect picking because of new, GPU based method.
