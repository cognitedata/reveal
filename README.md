# Reveal 3D viewer and libraries #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cognitedata/reveal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cognitedata/reveal)

Documentation for the latest version is available at [https://cognitedata.github.io/reveal/docs/](https://cognitedata.github.io/reveal/docs/)

---

Reveal viewer a highly performant viewer for the Web written in a combination of TypeScript and Rust.

This repository contains the source code for the new version of the Cognite Reveal 3D viewer,
including its file loading libraries.

## Prerequisites ##
Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

### Install wasm-pack

##### Windows

With Rust installed and ready to go, open a command shell and run `cargo install wasm-pack`

##### Linux / macOS

You can either run the same command as in Windows, or install it faster through https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/

## Getting started ##

To test the viewer, you need to build the viewer and then the serve script will handle dependencies for examples:

```
cd viewer
yarn install
yarn build
yarn serve
```

If you now navigate to [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000), you will see a list of examples
that can be explored in the browser.

## Publishing Viewer (Dev only)

To publish a new version of a viewer follow these steps.
1) Create new release branch or check out existing release branch
> **Note**: A release branch is prefixed by `release/` and followed by the major and minor number, e.g. `release/0.8`.
2) Bump up the version in the `viewer/package.json` file
> **Note**: When bumping up major and minor version remember that you need to make a new release branch.
3) Change directory to the viewer folder, `cd viewer`
4) Run in terminal `yarn publishscript`

## Use local build with a project that uses reveal (Dev only)

There are 2 different types of projects: 
1) These where CDN is available (no restrictive Content-Security-Policy is set)
2) Projects with CSP (like CDF)

Because we use workers and wasm files from CDN in our production builds,
we need to change [webpack `publicPath`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path/) setting to some local path, where 
the latest worker/wasm files could be found. 

We can use our examples for that purpose. 

1. Set `PUBLIC_URL` env variable for viewer build pointing to running examples, e.g. 

```bash
export PUBLIC_URL=https://localhost:8080/
```

make sure to have ending slash, it matters, 
because URLs for worker/wasm files are generated by webpack as `publicPath + chunkName`.

2. Run viewer build

```bash
cd viewer
yarn run build
```

3. Make sure examples are running (they are nothing more than a static server for our files)

```bash
cd ../examples
yarn run start
```

4. Next, you can use the build from `viewer/dist` as you normally would for local development.
You can simply use it as a link dependency in the project that uses reveal if 
the target project uses yarn as its package manager.

  * Replace reveal version with the link on `viewer/dist` in the project `package.json`
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@cognite/reveal": "link:<absolute or relative path to viewer/dist"
  }
}
```
  * After that, run `yarn` in the target project.
  * Don't forget you must not commit that change to the target project.
    
If you don't want to replace reveal version with a link, you can use CLI utility [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link)
or [yarn link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link/). To do that:

1. Create a link

```bash
cd viewer/dist
npm link
``` 

2. Use the link in your target project

```bash
cd your-project-path
npm link @cognite/reveal
```

Now reveal should be replaced with the local build. 

When you don't need it linked in the target project anymore, run:

```bash
npm unlink @cognite/reveal
```

To unregister the link from your local environment:

```bash
cd viewer/dist
npm unlink
```
