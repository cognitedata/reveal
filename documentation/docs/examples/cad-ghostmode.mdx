title: Ghost mode for CAD
describe: In ghost mode most of the geometry is made transparent to highlight interesting objects

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/src/components/DemoWrapper';

"Ghosting" can be used to make parts of the model appear transparent and with a fixed color to highlight
other objects and provide context for location. Reveal supports toggling ghosting of CAD models using 
`Cognite3DModel.ghostNodeByTreeindex` and `Cognite3DModel.unghostNodeByTreeIndex`. In addition, ghosting 
for all nodes can be toggled using `Cognite3DModel.ghostAllNodes` and `Cognite3DModel.unghostAllNodes`.

## Examples

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" />

### Ghost model to identify the location of a piece of equipment

A typical use case for ghosting is to show the location of a piece of equipment. To do this,
first ghost all nodes and unghost the relevant nodes.

```jsx runnable
model.ghostAllNodes();
model.unghostNodeByTreeIndex(409228, applyToChildren=true);
```

### Picking in ghost mode

When nodes are ghosted, they are not clickable and the user will be able to click nodes that otherwise
would be occluded by the ghosted nodes.


```jsx runnable
```
