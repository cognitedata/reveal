The `MeasurementTool` is a measuring tool for point to point distance with the 3D objects.
This can be achieved by selecting a point on the 3D Object and drag the pointer to the destined point to get measurement of the distance.
The tools default measurement is in "Meters" as supported in Reveal, but the tool provides user to customise the measuring units
based on their convinience.

The tool provides ability to change measuring line width & color.

:::note
The tool supports only point to point measurement

## Point to point distance measurment
To enter into point to point measurement mode, use `MeasurementTool.enterMeasurementMode()` which will have default line width & color.

```jsx runnable
// import { MeasurementTool } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const measurementTool = new MeasurementTool(viewer);
measurementTool.enterMeasurementMode();
```
### Exit measurement
To exit from measurement mode, use `MeasurementTool.exitMeasurementMode()`.

```jsx runnable
// import { MeasurementTool } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const measurementTool = new MeasurementTool(viewer);
measurementTool.enterMeasurementMode();
measurementTool.exitMeasurementMode();
```

### Set width and color of the measuring line
To change width and color of the line, use `MeasurementTool.setLineOptions(lineOptions: MeasurementLineOptions)`. MeasurementLineOptions expects
  - `lineWidth` : number,
  - `color` : number

```jsx runnable
// import { MeasurementTool } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const lineOptions = {
  lineWidth: 0.004,
  color: 0xff0000
};
const measurementTool = new MeasurementTool(viewer);
measurementTool.enterMeasurementMode();
measurementTool.setLineOptions(lineOptions);
```

It's also possible to apply custom label content for the measurment.
The tool provides option of custom callback for the users. 'MeasurementOptions.changeMeasurementLabelMetrics` can be
used to trigger custom operation like change the measuring units to feet. 

```jsx runnable
// import { MeasurementTool } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const measurementTool = new MeasurementTool(viewer, {changeMeasurementLabelMetrics: (distance: number) => {
      // 1 meters = 3.281 feet
      const distanceInFeet = distance * 3.281;
      return { distance: distanceInFeet, units: 'ft'};
     }});
measurementTool.enterMeasurementMode();
```
