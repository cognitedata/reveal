# Introduction

Ornate is a tool to create rich, interactive work spaces built on top of CDF.

## Features

- Built with CDF, for CDF
- Easy diagramming system based on shapes:
  - Circles, Rectangles, Lines, Text
  - Custom images (Stamps)
  - PDF and Images (FileURLs) - with annotations on top
- Connectors to CDF (for e.g. FileURLs)
- Built in drawing tools to enable user interaction:
  - Drawing primitives (Circles, Rectangles, Lines, Text)
  - Stamp tool
  - List tool
- Ready to use React components
  - Ornate wrapper
  - Context menu
  - Tool bar
  - Color picker
  - Stamp tool / List tool popups

## Getting started

```javascript
yarn add @cognite/ornate
```

**Initialising the viewer**

```javascript
import { CogniteOrnate } from '@cognite/ornate';

const ornateViewer = new CogniteOrnate({
  container: '#cognite-ornate',
});
```

**React container**

Ornate comes with a React container out of the box.

```jsx
import { Ornate } from '@cognite/ornate/react';

<Ornate
  shapes={shapes}
  activeTool={activeTool}
  onReady={(instance) => {
    ornate.current = instance;
  }}
>
```

## Basic interactions

Ornate comes with predefined interactions out of the box.

- Left Mouse Button: Tool action (See below)
- Middle Mouse Button: Pan stage
- Right Mouse Button: Pan stage
- Holding Spacebar: Pan stage
- Mouse wheel: Zoom
- Touch pad: Pan & Zoom

There are two tools that come as default with Ornate - Select and Hand. Here, the Select tool can be used to select one or more shapes, and transform them.

## Shapes

Shapes are used to add all visual elements to the Canvas. The stories show a selection of shapes, from primitives to more advanced CDF aware shapes.
Adding these shapes are a simple function away.

```javascript
import { Circle } from '@cognite/ornate';

const circle = new Circle(ornate.current, {
  x: 300,
  y: 300,
  radius: 30,
  fill: 'green',
  groupId: 'group',
  forceSelectGroup: true,
});

ornate.current.addShape([circle]);
```

In React, you can pass these shapes into the `shapes` prop.

```jsx
<Ornate
  shapes={[circle]}
>
```

## Tools

Tools handle unique interactions with shapes and the stage. This can include simple movement around the stage, to drawing new shapes and creating lists of elements.

You can view the available tools in the stories below. Switching to the tool is simple

```javascript
ornate.current.setActiveTool('HAND');
```

or

```javascript
<Ornate activeTool="HAND" />
```

## Saving and Loading

Saving and loading a workspace can be done via the `export` and `import` methods.

Some shapes can take in functions as data. Since these cannot be stored, the `import` method takes in these additional arguments.

```javascript
const data = ornate.current.export();

// `.load` can also be used. This will wipe the whole workspace.
ornate.current.import(data, { fileUrl: { ... }});

```
