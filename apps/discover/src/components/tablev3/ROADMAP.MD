# TO DO:

- When resizing the table, the footer and expanding row should update the width
- Move the table to Cogs and use it from there
- Get rid of tableV2 throughout the project
- Remove the 2px border under sub-tables (not as simple as it sounds)
- Re-introduce the margin-left on sub-tables (not as simple as it sounds)
