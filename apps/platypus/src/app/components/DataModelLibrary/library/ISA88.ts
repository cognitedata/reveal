A recipe entity is the combination of a procedural element with associated
recipe information (e.g., header, formula, equipment requirements and other
information). General, site, master, and control recipes are recipe entities. One
example is a unit recipe (ANSI/ISA-88.01-1995, 5.3.2). "unit recipe: the part of
a control recipe that uniquely defines the contiguous production requirements
for a unit." (ANSI/ISA-88.01-1995, 3.62).
