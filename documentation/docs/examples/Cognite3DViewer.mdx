Cognite3DViewer is a component that used to ease migration from [@cognite/3d-viewer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cognite/3d-viewer).
It has mostly the same API and could be used when you don't need to control the scene or render loop,
i.e., just want to view some 3d models from CDF.

import { DemoWrapper } from '../../src/components/DemoWrapper';

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" />

```jsx
import { CogniteClient } from '@cognite/sdk';
import { Cognite3DViewer } from '@cognite/reveal';

const client = new CogniteClient({
  appId: 'cognite.reveal.docs.Cognite3DViewer',
});

// to view models from CDF authentication is required
client.loginWithOAuth({ project: 'publicdata' });

// some div in your html page for Cognite3DViewer to insert a canvas
const domElement = document.getElementById('canvas-wrapper');

async function main() {
  const viewer = new Cognite3DViewer({ sdk: client, domElement });

  // load a model and add it on 3d scene
  // https://console.cognitedata.com/publicdata/3d-models/4715379429968321/revisions/5688854005909501
  const model = await viewer.addModel({
    modelId: 4715379429968321,
    revisionId: 5688854005909501,
  });

  viewer.fitCameraToModel(model);

  // call viewer.dispose() when you don't need the viewer anymore
}
main();
```
