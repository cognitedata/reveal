description: Demo shows how to load 3d models from CDF with Cognite3DViewer.
---

`Cognite3DViewer` is a component that eases the migration from [@cognite/3d-viewer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cognite/3d-viewer).
It has mostly the same API and could be used when you don't need to control the scene or render loop,
i.e., just want to view some 3d models from CDF.

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/docs/components/DemoWrapper';

<DemoWrapper />

```jsx
import { CogniteClient } from '@cognite/sdk';
import { Cognite3DViewer } from '@cognite/reveal';

const loginManager = new LoginManager('publicdata', 'api');
const client = new CogniteClient({
  appId: 'myCadAppId',
  project: loginManager.project,
  getToken: async () => loginManager.getToken()
});

await client.authenticate();

// some div in your html page for Cognite3DViewer to insert a canvas
const domElement = document.getElementById('canvas-wrapper');

async function main() {
  const viewer = new Cognite3DViewer({ sdk: client, domElement });

  // load a model and add it on 3d scene
  // https://console.cognitedata.com/publicdata/3d-models/4715379429968321/revisions/5688854005909501
  const model = await viewer.addModel({
    modelId: 3356984403684032,
    revisionId: 6664823881595566,
  });
  viewer.loadCameraFromModel(model);

  // call viewer.dispose() when you don't need the viewer anymore
}
main();
```

`CogniteClient` version 6 and later requires a `getToken` function for authentication.
For this documentation we have made a class called `LoginManager` that handles this. To
access the `publicdata` project used in the examples in this documentation, you may use the `LoginManager` [class yourself](https://github.com/cognitedata/reveal/blob/a722e6ef34e026be9fa88d90e97bcf94a6610432/documentation/docs/utils/LoginManager.ts). Note that
accessing data in other projects may require different authentication flows not supported by the LoginManager.
You can read more about different types of authentication flows in [the CogniteClient documentation](https://docs.cognite.com/dev/guides/sdk/js/authentication/).

Models can be temporarily hidden using `CogniteCadModel.visible`. Note that
the viewer must be explicitly re-rendered after setting the visibility flag:

```js runnable
model.visible = false;
viewer.requestRedraw();

setTimeout(() => {
  model.visible = true;
  viewer.requestRedraw();
}, 5000);
```

Hiding models doesn't free any memory occupied by the model and should only be used
to temporarily hide a model when it's expected that it will shortly be shown again.

To also reclaim memory and permanently unloading the model, use
`Cognite3DViewer.removeModel()`:

```js runnable
viewer.removeModel(model)
```

## Setting custom background image

The recommended way to set a custom background image for Reveal is to add the image as background to the DOM and make the background color transparent by applying an alpha value of 0.
See an example of this below.

```js runnable
viewer.setBackgroundColor({ alpha: 0.0 });
viewer.domElement.style.backgroundImage = "url('https://i.imgur.com/8tcxHWh.jpeg')";
```

## Creating screenshots

Use `getScreenshot` to create a screenshot from the current camera position. By default the resolution of the image is set to match the size of the render canvas, but a custom resolution can be provided.
Whether or not to include UI in the screenshot can also be specified. When drawing UI, only the viewer DOM element and its children will be included in the image. The DOM is scaled to fit any provided resolution, 
and as a result some elements can be positioned incorrectly in regards to the 3D render. 

Note that `html2canvas` is used to draw UI and this has some limitations on what CSS properties it is able to render. For details see [the html2canvas documentation](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/documentation).

```js runnable
async function createScreenshot() {
  const url = await viewer.getScreenshot(1920, 1080, true);
  if (url) {
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.download = 'test';
    link.href = url;
    link.click();
  }
}
createScreenshot();
```

## Only loading a part of the model

In some cases, it might be useful to restrict the area for which geometry is loaded to only show a partial
view. This can be done using a `geometryFilter` which allows only loading geometry within a provided box:

```js runnable
viewer.models.forEach(x => viewer.removeModel(x));

async function addFilteredModel() {
  const model = await viewer.addModel({
    modelId: 3356984403684032,
    revisionId: 6664823881595566,
    geometryFilter: {
      // Only load geometry inside a box around origin with 50x50 horizontal extent and 10 vertical extent.
      boundingBox: new THREE.Box3(new THREE.Vector3(75, 50, 49), new THREE.Vector3(125, 100, 59))
    }
  });
  viewer.fitCameraToModel(model);
}
addFilteredModel();
```

By default, the bounds provided must be in "CDF coordinates". This is e.g. suitable if you are retrieving coordinates
directly from the [Nodes API](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#operation/get3DNodes) to for instance show the area
around a given node. If the coordinates are in "Reveal coordinates" (i.e. in
[the WebGL coordinate system](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/webgl/webgl_basics.htm)) the `geometryFilter` can be
set up using `isBoundingBoxInModelCoordinates`:

```js runnable
viewer.models.forEach(x => viewer.removeModel(x));

async function addFilteredModel() {
  const model = await viewer.addModel({
    modelId: 3356984403684032,
    revisionId: 6664823881595566,
    geometryFilter: {
      // Only load geometry inside a box around origin with 50x50 horizontal extent and 10 vertical extent.
      boundingBox: new THREE.Box3(new THREE.Vector3(75, 49, -100), new THREE.Vector3(125, 59, -50)),
      // Instruct Reveal that the coordinates already are relative to the coordinates of the model
      isBoundingBoxInModelCoordinates: true
    }
  });
  viewer.fitCameraToModel(model);
}
addFilteredModel();
```
