Reveal supports selecting/highlighting individual objects by providing [tree indices to identify 3D nodes](../concepts.md).

Highlighting makes a 3D object stand out and always be visible. Highlighted objects are
rendered in front of other objects, are given an outline and a special color.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/highlighted-object.png')} alt="Highlighted object" />

## Examples

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" />

### Highlight nodes of a subtree

The 3D nodes are organized in a tree structure, where e.g. equipment will have many sub-components. In
order to highlight equipment it's typically necessary to highlight the entire
subtree. Reveal supports this through the use of `Cognite3DModel.selectNodeByTreeIndex` with `applyToChildren`
set to `true`:

```jsx runnable
model.selectNodeByTreeIndex(923980, applyToChildren=true);
```

### Reset highlighting

Nodes can be deselected using `Cognite3DModel.deselectNodeByTreeIndex`, e.g.

```jsx runnable
model.iterateNodesByTreeIndex(treeIndex => {
  model.deselectNodeByTreeIndex(treeIndex);
});
```

It's also possible (and more performant) to use `Cognite3DModel.deselectAllNodes()` when
you want to deselect all nodes:

```jsx runnable
model.deselectAllNodes();
```

### Highlight a single object on click

`Cognite3DViewer.on('click', ...)` can be used to handle mouse click events. This example shows how to highlight objects that are clicked.

```jsx runnable
viewer.on('click', event => {
  const intersection = viewer.getIntersectionFromPixel(
    event.offsetX, event.offsetY
  );
  if (intersection) {
    // Deselect any previous selected node
    intersection.model.deselectAllNodes();
    // Select clicked object
    intersection.model.selectNodeByTreeIndex(intersection.treeIndex);
  };
});
```

### Highlight tagged equipment

Equipment in CAD models typically consists of several smaller parts.
When the user clicks an object in the 3D model, she or he will click one of the individual small parts.

The following example shows how to use node data retrieved from the Cognite SDK to determine to "tagged equipment"
(i.e. named equipment) and highlighting the full equipment, rather than a single individual part.

```jsx runnable
viewer.on('click', event => {
  const intersection = viewer.getIntersectionFromPixel(
    event.offsetX, event.offsetY
  );
  model.deselectAllNodes();
  if (intersection) {
    const model = intersection.model;
    const { modelId, revisionId } = model;
    // Map treeIndex to nodeId to be able to lookup node in CDF
    model.mapTreeIndexToNodeId(intersection.treeIndex).then(nodeId => {
      sdk.revisions3D.list3DNodeAncestors(modelId, revisionId, nodeId).then(ancestors => {
        // Find first ancestor whose name starts with "/" - we assume this
        // is the a tagged equipment
        const taggedEquipment = ancestors.items.find(
          x => x.name.startsWith('/')
        );
        if (taggedEquipment) {
          // Highlight tagged equipment and all children
          model.selectNodeByTreeIndex(taggedEquipment.treeIndex, true);
        }
      })
    })
  }
});
```
