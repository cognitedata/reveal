description: Usage of pointcloud models with Cognite3DViewer
---

`@cognite/reveal` supports point clouds through a third-party library, [`potree-core`](https://github.com/tentone/potree-core). The viewer
supports loading both point clouds and CAD models at the same time. Point clouds can be generated from various sources including
[laser scans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_scanning) and [photogrammetry models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry).
Loading point clouds is done with identical code to when [loading CAD models](./cad-basic) - Reveal will determine that the model
is a point cloud model and act accordingly.

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/docs/components/DemoWrapper';

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" modelType="pointcloud" />

```jsx
import { CogniteClient } from '@cognite/sdk';
import { Cognite3DViewer } from '@cognite/reveal';

const client = new CogniteClient({
  appId: 'cognite.reveal.docs.Cognite3DViewer',
});

// to view models from CDF authentication is required
client.loginWithOAuth({ project: 'publicdata' });

// some div in your html page for Cognite3DViewer to insert a canvas
const domElement = document.getElementById('canvas-wrapper');

async function main() {
  const viewer = new Cognite3DViewer({ sdk: client, domElement });

  // load a model and add it on 3d scene
  // https://console.cognitedata.com/publicdata/3d-models/4715379429968321/revisions/5688854005909501
  const model = await viewer.addModel({
    modelId: 4715379429968321,
    revisionId: 5688854005909501,
  });
  viewer.loadCameraFromModel(model);

  // call viewer.dispose() when you don't need the viewer anymore
}
main();
```

## Point size

You can use `pointSize` property to set the size of each rendered point in a point cloud model.

```js runnable
model.pointSize = 10;
```

## Point budget

The point budget limits the number of points loaded and rendered at any given time,
which helps to adapt performance requirements to the capabilities of different hardware.
Recommended values are between 500.000 and 10.000.000.

```js runnable
model.pointBudget = 500000;
```

## Point shape

You can set the point shape of each rendered point in the point cloud. Values are defined by `PotreePointShape` enum.

```js runnable
// import { PotreePointShape } from '@cognite/reveal';
model.pointShape = PotreePointShape.Square;
```

## Point color type

You can specify in which way points should be colored. Values are defined by `PotreePointColorType` enum.

```js runnable
// import { PotreePointColorType } from '@cognite/reveal'
model.pointColorType = PotreePointColorType.Depth;
```

Other useful coloring schemes are `Rgb` (color) , `Classification` (color by point class) and `Intensity`
(strength of the backscattered signal in a laser scan).

## Classification filtering

Some point clouds have classification information associated with each point.  This can
be used for coloring or to filter the point cloud.

:::note
The demonstration model doesn't have classification data so the examples below are not
runnable.
:::

To list classes available in a point cloud model, use `CognitePointCloudModel.getClasses`:

```js
const classes = model.getClasses();
for (const pointClass of classes) {
  console.log(pointClass); // Prints a numeric class code
}
```

It's also possible to check if a model has a given class by using `CognitePointCloudModel.hasClass`.
A list of well-known point class codes are defined in `WellKnownAsprsPointClassCodes`. These definitions
by the [ASPRS LAS 1.4 specifications](http://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/LAS_1_4_r14.pdf).

To filter away certain classes, use `CognitePointCloudModel.setClassVisible`:

```js
model.setClassVisible(WellKnownAsprsPointClassCodes.Ground, false);
```

To check if a class currently is visible, use `isClassVisible`:

```js
const visible = model.isClassVisible(WellKnownAsprsPointClassCodes.Ground);
```

## Unloading models

Point clouds (and CAD models) can be unloaded using `Cognite3DViewer.removeModel()`:

```js runnable
viewer.removeModel(model)
```
