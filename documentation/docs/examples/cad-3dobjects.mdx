Sometimes it's useful to add custom content to the 3D scene to model data Reveal doesn't
support or to customize the 3D environment. Reveal supports this by using the
`Cognite3DViewer.addObject3D`-function which accepts [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) objects.

:::note
Reveal uses an "implicit lighting model", i.e. no lights are added to the scene. If you
need lights this needs to be added to the viewer scene if the added objects isn't "unlit".

## Adding markers to the scene on clicks

The following example reacts to clicks in the scene and adds markers to the positions clicked.

```jsx runnable
const markerGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 10, 10);
const markerMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  color: 'blue',
  transparent: true,
  opacity: 0.7
});
viewer.on('click', async event => {
  const intersection = await viewer.getIntersectionFromPixel(event.offsetX, event.offsetY);
  if (intersection) {
    const marker = new THREE.Mesh(markerGeometry, markerMaterial);
    marker.position.copy(intersection.point);
    viewer.addObject3D(marker);
  }
});
```

## Load external GLTF content

[GLTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) is a commonly used 3D format for content delivery - think of it as the JPG of 3D.
GLTF is supported by ThreeJS and can easily be added to Reveal using [`GLTFLoader`](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader).
GLTF is great for creating custom 3D content with high fidelity, and is supported by most 3D design software,
e.g. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). There's also several services for generating GLTF content (e.g. [ElevationAPI](https://elevationapi.com/))
and market places for 3D models for download (e.g. [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) and [Turbosquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/)) - allowing you
to quickly build "digital worlds" with Reveal.

In the following example, a GLTF model is loaded and placed in the clicked positions in the CAD model. The 3D model is from 
[Grand Dog Studio on Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/3d-industrial-tanker-a9d3dac0c55042989309bdcf68c60f76) under 
[the CC 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

```jsx runnable
// import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader';

const loader = new GLTFLoader();
function onLoaded(gltf) {
  gltf.scene.scale.set(0.2, 0.2, 0.2);
  const objectBounds = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(gltf.scene);

  viewer.on('click', async event => {
    const intersection = await viewer.getIntersectionFromPixel(event.offsetX, event.offsetY);
    if (intersection) {
      const clonedScene = gltf.scene.clone();
      intersection.point.y += (objectBounds.max.y - objectBounds.min.y) * 0.5;
      clonedScene.position.copy(intersection.point);
      viewer.addObject3D(clonedScene);
      console.log(clonedScene);
    }
  });

  alert('Loaded GLTF! Click the 3D model to place model');
}
function onProgress() {
}
function onError(error) {
  alert('Loading GLTF failed: ' + error);
}

// Add a "sun"
const sun = new THREE.PointLight();
sun.position.set(500, 500, 500);
viewer.addObject3D(sun);
viewer.addObject3D(new THREE.AmbientLight())

// Load and add 3D model
loader.load(gltfModelUrl, onLoaded, onProgress, onError);
```

## Add environment

To make a model feel more natural it might be useful to add an environment. The following
example adds sky and a sea effect for the example oil rig.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('/img/cad-skyandocean.png')}
  alt="Oil rig with sky and ocean"
/>

Below you'll find [an interactive example](#interactive-example), but first lets walk through
the different parts.
See the bottom of this page for an interactive example.

First, let's encapsulate the model in a large sky-textured sphere to create an illusion of
skies. The sphere map is available from [Free HDR - EXR SKIES-blog](http://freepanorama.blogspot.com/).

```js
const modelCenterAtSeaLevel = model
  .getModelBoundingBox()
  .getCenter(new THREE.Vector3());
modelCenterAtSeaLevel.y = 0.0;

// Skybox
const skyBox = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.SphereGeometry(3000, 15, 15),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
    side: THREE.BackSide,
    // Skybox texture from http://freepanorama.blogspot.com/2010/01/sky7-spherical.html
    map: new THREE.TextureLoader().load(skyUrl),
  })
);
skyBox.position.copy(modelCenterAtSeaLevel);
viewer.addObject3D(skyBox);
```

This looks a bit better, but the oil rig appears to be floating mid-air at this point. Lets
add an ocean. A plane is rendered at the sea level.

```js
// Water
const waterGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(6000, 6000, 63, 63);

const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  map: new THREE.TextureLoader().load(
      'https://threejs.org/examples/textures/water.jpg',
      (texture) => {
      texture.wrapS = texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
    }),
  color: { value: new THREE.Color(0x0099ff)},
  side: THREE.DoubleSide
});

const water = new THREE.Mesh(waterGeometry, material);
// Make the ocean horizontal
water.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;
water.position.copy(modelCenterAtSeaLevel);
viewer.addObject3D(water);
```

### Interactive example

Below is the complete code for adding a skybox and ocean to the scene.

```jsx runnable
const modelCenterAtSeaLevel = model
  .getModelBoundingBox()
  .getCenter(new THREE.Vector3());
modelCenterAtSeaLevel.y = 0.0;

// Skybox
const skyBox = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.SphereGeometry(3000, 15, 15),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
    side: THREE.BackSide,
    // Skybox texture from http://freepanorama.blogspot.com/2010/01/sky7-spherical.html
    map: new THREE.TextureLoader().load(skyUrl),
  })
);
skyBox.position.copy(modelCenterAtSeaLevel);
viewer.addObject3D(skyBox);

// Water
const waterGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(6000, 6000, 63, 63);

const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  map: new THREE.TextureLoader().load(
      'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Water_texture_1390894_Nevit.jpg/2048px-Water_texture_1390894_Nevit.jpg',
      (texture) => {
      texture.wrapS = texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
    }),
  color: { value: new THREE.Color(0x0099ff)},
  side: THREE.DoubleSide
});

const water = new THREE.Mesh(waterGeometry, material);
// Make the ocean horizontal
water.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;
water.position.copy(modelCenterAtSeaLevel);
viewer.addObject3D(water);

//Make sure the Skybox & ocean plane have applied textures
setTimeout(() => {
  viewer.requestRedraw();
}, 100);

```
