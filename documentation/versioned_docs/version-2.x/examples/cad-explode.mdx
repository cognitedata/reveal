title: Exploded view tool
description: Demo use the exploded view tool to explode and inspect a given node subtree.

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/docs/components/DemoWrapper';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

This section describes the exploded view tool, which contains helper functions and logic for inspecting and exploding a given asset.
The constructor of this tool needs to be supplied with a [tree index](../concepts.md) which is the tree index of the root of the asset, and an instance of the `Cognite3DModel` that the asset belongs to.

:::note
For performance reasons, the root tree index must have a subtree size of less than 1000, else it will throw an error.
:::

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" />

`ExplodedViewTool` contains two instance methods: `expand` and `reset`.
`expand` takes a float describing how far the individual nodes should be expanded (this will vary based on the initial vector between the node and root).
`reset` resets the tool and any transform that has been applied to any nodes.

:::note
`ExplodedViewTool` contains a promise: `readyPromise`, which indicates when the tool is ready to be used.
This indicates if the tool has cached necessary data from the Cognite Fusion API to determine the individual locations of the nodes in the subtree.
:::

Below is an example that expands a given pipe asset (that has a tree index of `570730`) which is animated by a sine function.
Another good usecase would be to bind the `expand` function to a slider which the user can manipulate to expand the asset.


```jsx runnable
// import { ExplodedViewTool } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';
async function animate() {
  const rootTreeIndex = 570730;

  const explodeTool = new ExplodedViewTool(rootTreeIndex, model);

  model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Hidden);
  const explodedIndices = new TreeIndexNodeCollection(
    await model.getSubtreeTreeIndices(rootTreeIndex)
  );
  model.assignStyledNodeCollection(explodedIndices, DefaultNodeAppearance.Default);

  const rootBoundingBox = await model.getBoundingBoxByTreeIndex(rootTreeIndex);
  viewer.fitCameraToBoundingBox(rootBoundingBox, 0);
  await explodeTool.readyPromise;

  const clock = new THREE.Clock(true);
  clock.start();

  setInterval(() =>{
    const elapsedTime = clock.getElapsedTime();
    const expandRadius = Math.sin(elapsedTime) * 0.5 + 0.5;
    explodeTool.expand(expandRadius);
  }, 20);
}
animate();
```
