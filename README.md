# Developing on Visual Studio Code

Recommended extensions:
- [Jest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest) - for continously running unit tests and showing results inline in the editor.

# Starting development web server

- Start the web server: `npm install && npm serve`
- Open a browser to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Web server will restart and browser will automatically update whenever a file changes.
