Reveal is a blazing fast library for visualizing huge 3D models on the web. It's written in a combination of TypeScript and Rust.

Reveal is used to make any model uploaded to [Cognite Data Fusion](https://www.cognite.com/en/cognite-data-fusion) (CDF)
visible to users right in their web browsers with outstanding performance.
It is achieved by streaming and parsing data in Rust and WebAssembly, 
which allows us to load even huge models within seconds.
