title: Filtering nodes by node properties
describe: Applying styles to nodes based on node properties/attributes

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/docs/components/DemoWrapper';

3D nodes may have assosciated attribute/property data. Reveal allows for filtering based on
these properties, allowing queries such as "all pipes", "nodes within module P600" or "nodes
with status S5". Combinations are also possible by using `CombinedNodeSet`.

`ByNodePropertyNodeSet` is used to query nodes based on node properties. It's possible to specify
multiple criterias which will be combined using `AND` - i.e. all criterias must be met for a node
to match. To emulate `OR`, use `CombinedNodeSet` with a `union`-operator.

Note that if a node is in a `ByNodePropertyNodeSet` all of its children will also be
in the set.

:::note
The test model used in the documentation site is lacking and the examples shown is somewhat lacking
as a result of this. To best utilize the filtering APIs we recommend providing a rich 3D models
with a good set of high-quality attributes associated with the nodes.

# Show all pipes

If nodes in the 3D model has an attribute `'PDMS.Type'`, `ByNodePropertyNodeSet` can be used to
retrieve nodes of a certain type. In the following example, only pipes are accepted:

```js runnable
const allPipes = new ByNodePropertyNodeSet(sdk, model);
allPipes.executeFilter({'PDMS': {'Type': 'PIPE'}});
model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.addStyledNodeSet(allPipes, { renderGhosted: false, color: [40, 200, 20] } );
```

# Partioning requests

For filters that match a lot of nodes, [paritioned requests](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#section/Parallel-retrieval)
might increase the performance radically by fetching result from the server in parallel.
To partition requests, provide the number of partitions using the `requestPartitions`-option
to the `ByNodePropertyNodeSet`-constructor:

```js runnable
const nodesFromFile = new ByNodePropertyNodeSet(sdk, model, { requestPartitions: 10 });
// All nodes originating from a given file
nodesFromFile.executeFilter({'Item': {'Source File': 'PRO-S_CD-MUM.rvm'}});
model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.addStyledNodeSet(nodesFromFile, { renderGhosted: false, outlineColor: NodeOutlineColor.Orange } );
```

To compare speed-up, set `requestPartitions` to `1`.

# Combining filters

Often one would want to match multiple criterias of the same type. Lets say we want to find all
mechanical equipment with purpose 'STU'. We can either execute this as a single query, or as two
seperate queries.

When doing this as a single query, no `CombinedNodeSet` is necessary and the code is quite compact:

```js runnable
const stuMechNodes = new ByNodePropertyNodeSet(sdk, model);
stuMechNodes.executeFilter({'PDMS': {':capDisc': 'MECH', 'Purpose': 'STU' }});

model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.addStyledNodeSet(stuMechNodes, { renderGhosted: false, color: [40, 200, 20] } );
```

Combining two separate queries requires the use of `CombinedNodeSet`:

```js runnable
const mechNodes = new ByNodePropertyNodeSet(sdk, model);
mechNodes.executeFilter({'PDMS': {':capDisc': 'MECH'}});
const stuNodes = new ByNodePropertyNodeSet(sdk, model);
stuNodes.executeFilter({'PDMS': {'Purpose': 'STU'}});
const combined = new CombinedNodeSet('intersection');
combined.addSet(mechNodes);
combined.addSet(stuNodes);

model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.addStyledNodeSet(combined, { renderGhosted: false, color: [40, 200, 20] } );
```

The two approaches as their pros and cons. Often it will be faster to combine the
filters into a single query as this will reduce the result set returned from the
server. However, if the different combinations will be configured run-time (e.g.
the user will want to show 'ARCH'-nodes within the 'STU'-purpose) it might
be better to use two separate queries and combine the results. Also, the latter
approach also allows for more complex types of filters.

# Inverting filters

Often it is interesting to invert results from filters to find elements that does not match the query. This
can be done using `InvertNodeSet`.

```js runnable
const livingQuarters = new ByNodePropertyNodeSet(sdk, model);
livingQuarters.executeFilter({'Item': {'Name': '/SLP/S/LQ'}});
const notLivingQuarters = new InvertedNodeSet(model, livingQuarters);

model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.addStyledNodeSet(notLivingQuarters, { renderGhosted: false } );
```
