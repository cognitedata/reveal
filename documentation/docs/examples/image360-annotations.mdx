360-images may be connected to _annotations_ that outline regions of interest in the images. They are only visible when the user has entered the 360 image with which they are associated. Reveal automatically finds and downloads any relevant annotations from CDF and displays them by default.

### Annotation requirements

Reveal only considers annotations following specific requirements. For an annotation to be found by Reveal, it must have its `annotatedResourceId` set to the ID of an image file belonging to the 360 image set. Furthermore, `annotatedResourceType` must be `"file"` and `annotationType` must be `"images.ObjectDetection"`. The annotation's `data` field must be assigned to an `Images.ObjectDetection` object. Currently, only `Images.ObjectDetection` objects containing either a `boundingBox` or a `polygon` is supported, `polyline` annotations will not be displayed. See [the CDF documentation](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#tag/Annotations/operation/annotationsCreate) for more information.

Annotations are represented by `Image360Annotation` instances. The annotations associated with a given entity revision can be listed with the `revision.annotations` property.

## Styling Annotations

By default, annotations are assigned a random color, grouped by the annotations' `data.label` property.

The appearance of annotations can be changed both through a "default" style and through styling annotations individually.

### Default style

To set a default style for all annotations in an `Image360Collection`, you may call the `collection.setDefaultStyle(appearance)`, where `collection` is an `Image360Collection` instance. The `appearance` argument is an `Image360AnnotationAppearance` instance, which has the following content:

#### `Image360AnnotationAppearance`

| Field        | Field type                | Description                                      |
|--------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `color`      | `THREE.Color?`            | The color of the annotation                      |
| `visibility` | `boolean?`                | Whether the annotation should be visible or not  |

Leaving any of the fields undefined causes the annotations to revert to the original value for that property.

Using this, we can e.g. hide all annotations using

```js
collection.setDefaultAnnotationStyle({ visibility: false });
```

### Individual style

Setting individual style can be done directly on an `Image360Annotation` object. Styling fields set this way will override those of the default appearance. To e.g. hide all annotations in a revision with the label `"pipe"`, you may write

```js
revision.annotations
  .filter(a => a.annotation.data.label === 'pipe')
  .forEach(a => a.setVisibility(false));
```

## Events

Reveal exposes events that trigger on cursor-annotation interactions, namely `'image360AnnotationHovered'` and `'image360AnnotationClicked'` events. They represent events where the mouse pointer hovers over or clicks an annotation, respectively. The user may listen for these events on the `Image360Collection` instance.

To e.g. color every clicked annotation with a blue color, you may write

```js
collection.on('image360AnnotationClicked',
              a => a.setColor(new THREE.Color(0, 0, 1)));
```
