# @cognite/copilot-core

**For now, this is deployed to the `cdf-copilot-core` npm package. We will deploy @cognite org name soon once we have a proper v0.1**

This is the core logic part of copilot, where both the UI and business logic lives. Most apps (ones in fusion) will not need to import the UI part, simply just need to update the business logic.

We will go over how the business logic works first, and UI second.

## Feature Flag

To have the copilot feature enabled on your project, you would also need to have this feature flag enabled for your project here https://unleash-apps.cognite.ai/projects/default/features/COGNITE_COPILOT.

# Business logic part

For the Copilot, there are 3 categories of logic, both living in `src/lib`:

1. Chat bot flow - the UX of the chatbot and **how it interacts with the user**

2. Toolchains of the copilot - the backbone of the chat bot, where **each toolchain is a tool that the user have access to**. Each toolchain may need to communicate with the base application, thus:

3. Events - the **communication between the copilot and the base application.**

## 1. Chat bot flow

### `processMessage`

Given a message from the user, what should we reply and respond with.

- params:
  - `message`
  - `pastMessages`(includes the current `message` in the first parameter)
  - `async sendMessage()` - allows the bot to send a message to the user
- returns: `Promise<Boolean>`, should continue letting users do input or not.

> This process message by default will call the **router chain** as the main toolchain that identifies which tool to use to solve the identified user intent. More on this in next section

### `getActions`

Given the current list of messages, what are some recommended actions that the user can do.

- params:
  - `pastMessages`
  - async `sendMessage()`
- returns: `Promise<Actions[]>` - what buttons the user has access to for perfoming an action

Note: if the `pastMesages` are empty, assume you are starting the conversation with the user. Hence the sendMessage is super useful for giving context to the user, while the actions provide some quick ways to get started.

## 2. Toolchains

Toolchains are defined in `src/lib/toolchains`. The toolchains are categorized into different feature, but each can be "chained" to the result of another. How it works is as following:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Prompt[Prompt] --> Router(Router Chain)
    Router --> Chain1[Chain 1]:::Chain
    Router --> Chain2[Chain 2]:::Chain
    Router --> Chain[...]
    Router --> ChainN[Chain N]:::Chain
    Chain1 --> Ready[Ready for next prompt]
    Chain2 --> Ready[Ready for next prompt]
    Chain --> Ready[Ready for next prompt]
    ChainN --> Ready[Ready for next prompt]

    style Prompt fill:none,stroke-width:0px
    style Router fill:purple,stroke-width:0px
    style Chain stroke-width:0px,fill:none
    classDef Chain fill:none,stroke:purple, stroke-width:2px
    style Ready fill:green,stroke-width:0px
```

and within each chain:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    ChainStart --> TOOL1 --> TOOL2 --> TOOLN --> ... --> ChainEnd
    subgraph TOOL1[Some tool talks to users]
        direction TB
        ToolChain1 --> bot[Send Message as bot]:::bot
    end
    subgraph TOOL2[Some tool talks to users]
        direction TB
        ToolChain2 --> bot2[Send Message as bot]:::bot --> prompt:::bot
    end
    subgraph TOOLN[Some tool just processes data]
        direction TB
        ToolChain3
    end

    style ChainStart fill:purple,stroke:none
    style ChainEnd fill:purple,stroke:none
    classDef bot fill:none,stroke:none,font-family:monospace,font-size:12px,color:red

```

> The router chain is defined in `src/lib/toolchains/router/router.ts` and the most important chain - this gets triggered when we get a message from the user typically from `processMessage` and it will route the message to the correct toolchain.

To add a tool chain, simply:

1. Create a new toolchain in the `src/lib/toolchains` folder (under a feature group preferably), make sure the tool chain extends from `CogniteBaseChain`.
2. Code the chain, in here you have access to the sdk, the latest message and also the ability to communicate to the app or send message to the user via `ToCopilot.NEW_MESSAGES` **with the source as bot!** (more in the next section).
   > We recommend taking a look at the simple `appBuilder.ts` toolchain to get started.
3. Add the new toolchain in the `src/lib/toolchains/index.ts` file, and add it to the `ChainName` type with the literal of the name. and to
   `destinationChains` mapping between the name and the instantiated chain.
4. Watch the magic happen and give yourself a high five (or high five here üñêÔ∏è).

## 3. Communicating between Copilot <-> App

We communicate between the Copilot and the App via CustomMessage. We provide a variety of helpers for making this communication easy. To define these special events, there are 2 categories of events and event listener - `fromCopilot` and `toCopilot`, which intuitively describes event (or listening to events) that are "from" or "to" the Copilot.

These are defined in the [types](./src/lib/types.ts) file.

Let's walk through an example:

```typescript
type CopilotEvents = {
  FromCopilot: {
    // get all code from streamlit
    GET_CODE: null;
  };
  ToCopilot: {
    // get all code from streamlit
    GET_CODE: {
      content?: string;
    };
  };
};
```

**Copilot side**

Now, lets say in `processMessage` in Copilot, you want to trigger an event to get all the code, then you can do the following.

In this case, you want to add a way to listen for `GET_CODE` **from** the App, and then send a `GET_CODE` event **to** the App.

```typescript
// creates a listener for `GET_CODE_RESPONSE` from Copilot, we will use the returned function later
const removeEventListener = addToCopilotEventListener('GET_CODE', (event) => {
  // do something with the event.content code
  // ...

  removeEventListener();
});

// send the event to the App (from the Copilot) to trigger a response.
sendFromCopilotEvent('GET_CODE', null);
```

**App side**

You would do the inverse of the To/From but the same logic as above in the app. However, you can also use the provided hook builder - `createCopilotEventHandlerHooks`.

In this case you are listening to `GET_CODE` **from** the Copilot, and then sending a `GET_CODE` **to** the Copilot.

```typescript
// creates a handler for `GET_CODE_RESPONSE` from Copilot
const handler = useCallback(() => {
  sendToCopilotEvent('GET_CODE', {
    content: editorRef?.getModel()?.getValue(),
  });
});

// creates a listener for `GET_CODE` from Copilot
useFromCopilotEventHandler('GET_CODE', handler);
```

# UI part

`/src/app` contains all the code for the UI, which is divided in 2, the Button itself and the Chat UI.

<img style="max-width:300px" src="./assets/example.png" />

Most uses of this fusion is not needed as the Button and Chat are globally mounted by the `@cognite/cdf-copilot` subapp (another `app` in this repo.).

The Button triggers the copilot via a CustomEvent via window. This means any other app can simply pass the same CustomEvent and trigger the open / closing of the Chat UI. This is also the way the Chatbot will communicate with other UIs on the screen.

However, this is needed for other non fusion apps to mount the copilot itself.

### How to use the UI aspect of the data model.

Simply import the `Copilot` component from the library and mount it. It expects a valid `sdk` (CogniteClient) and a `feature` name, which it needs to identify the business logic to run. We will go over this in the previous section.

Make sure to create a file like the following

```typescript
/* eslint-disable import/no-webpack-loader-syntax */

/**  This is the built in way how to load the web workers using webpack is with worker-loader */
import { loader } from '@monaco-editor/react';
import * as monaco from 'monaco-editor';
/**  This is the built in way how to load the web workers using webpack is with worker-loader */
import { Environment as MonacoEditorEnvironment } from 'monaco-editor';
import MonacoEditorWorker from 'worker-loader?esModule=true&inline=fallback!monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/editor.worker?worker';

// point here so the context can be used
declare const self: any;

(self as any).MonacoEnvironment = {
  getWorker(_: string, _label: string) {
    // otherwise, load the default web worker from monaco
    return new MonacoEditorWorker();
  },
} as MonacoEditorEnvironment;

loader.config({ monaco });
```

and import it in the root.

Additionally, make sure to load in the styles!

```js
import 'highlight.js/styles/dracula.css';
import 'monaco-editor/dev/vs/editor/editor.main.css';
import 'react-resizable/css/styles.css';
import '@cognite/cogs.js/dist/cogs.css';
```

then

```js
import { Copilot } from '@cognite/copilot-core';
import { CogniteClient } from '@cognite/sdk';
...

const sdk = new CogniteClient({ appId: 'Copilot' });

export const SomeComponent = () => {
  return <Copilot feature={'Something'} sdk={sdk} />;
};
```

## Local dev

In fusion, you can just run `yarn nx serve copilot` and it will have copilot, which is a simple wrapper on this library.

To host build the library by itself, you can just run `yarn nx build copilot-core --with-deps --watch`. The `--watch` will allow NX to watch for changes and rebuild the library.

Also, for debugging add `--skip-nx-cache` if you want to make sure it is always building, and not loading from cache.

The output of the library will be at `dist/libs/copilot-core`. This is good to know as you can run `yarn link` from the library, and then `yarn link @cognite/copilot-core` from the app you want to use it in. This will allow you to use the locally built library from the app. To see how yarn link works, [check here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/).

Note: you may have to do the same thing for `@cognite/sdk` and `monaco-editor`. To do this, go to `node_modules/<package>` like `node_modules/@cognite/sdk` and run yarn link from this repo, then in the other side side, do `yarn link <package>`.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test copilot-core` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
