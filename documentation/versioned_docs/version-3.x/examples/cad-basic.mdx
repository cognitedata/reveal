description: Demo shows how to load 3d models from CDF with Cognite3DViewer.

`Cognite3DViewer` is a component that eases the migration from [@cognite/3d-viewer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cognite/3d-viewer).
It has mostly the same API and could be used when you don't need to control the scene or render loop,
i.e., just want to view some 3d models from CDF.

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/versioned_docs/version-3.x/components/DemoWrapper';

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" />

```jsx
import { CogniteClient } from '@cognite/sdk';
import { Cognite3DViewer } from '@cognite/reveal';

const loginManager = new LoginManager('publicdata', 'api');
const client = new CogniteClient({
  appId: 'myCadAppId',
  project: loginManager.project,
  getToken: async () => loginManager.getToken()
});

await client.authenticate();

// some div in your html page for Cognite3DViewer to insert a canvas
const domElement = document.getElementById('canvas-wrapper');

async function main() {
  const viewer = new Cognite3DViewer({ sdk: client, domElement });

  // load a model and add it on 3d scene
  // https://console.cognitedata.com/publicdata/3d-models/4715379429968321/revisions/5688854005909501
  const model = await viewer.addModel({
    modelId: 3356984403684032,
    revisionId: 6664823881595566,
  });
  viewer.loadCameraFromModel(model);

  // call viewer.dispose() when you don't need the viewer anymore
}
main();
```

`CogniteClient` version 6 and later requires a `getToken` function for authentication.
In this documentation we have made a class called `LoginManager` that handles this. To
access the `publicdata` project you can use the [class yourself](insert link!), but
accessing data in other projects may require different authentication flows.
You can read more about different types of authentication flow in [the CogniteClient documentation](https://docs.cognite.com/dev/guides/sdk/js/authentication/).

Models can be temporarily hidden using `Cognite3DModel.visible`. Note that
the viewer must be explicitly re-rendered after setting the visibility flag:

```js runnable-3x
model.visible = false;
viewer.requestRedraw();

setTimeout(() => {
  model.visible = true;
  viewer.requestRedraw();
}, 5000);
```

Hiding models doesn't free any memory occupied by the model and should only be used
to temporarily hide a model when it's expected that it will shortly be shown again.

To also reclaim memory and permanently unloading the model, use
`Cognite3DViewer.removeModel()`:

```js runnable-3x
viewer.removeModel(model)
```

## Only loading a part of the model

In some cases, it might be useful to restrict the area for which geometry is loaded to only show a partial
view. This can be done using a `geometryFilter` which allows only loading geometry within a provided box:

```js runnable-3x
viewer.models.forEach(x => viewer.removeModel(x));

async function addFilteredModel() {
  const model = await viewer.addModel({
    modelId: 3356984403684032,
    revisionId: 6664823881595566,
    geometryFilter: {
      // Only load geometry inside a box around origin with 50x50 horizontal extent and 10 vertical extent.
      boundingBox: new THREE.Box3(new THREE.Vector3(75, 50, 49), new THREE.Vector3(125, 100, 59))
    }
  });
  viewer.fitCameraToModel(model);
}
addFilteredModel();
```

By default, the bounds provided must be in "CDF coordinates". This is e.g. suitable if you are retrieving coordinates
directly from the [Nodes API](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#operation/get3DNodes) to for instance show the area
around a given node. If the coordinates are in "Reveal coordinates" (i.e. in
[the WebGL coordinate system](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/webgl/webgl_basics.htm)) the `geometryFilter` can be
set up using `isBoundingBoxInModelCoordinates`:

```js runnable-3x
viewer.models.forEach(x => viewer.removeModel(x));

async function addFilteredModel() {
  const model = await viewer.addModel({
    modelId: 3356984403684032,
    revisionId: 6664823881595566,
    geometryFilter: {
      // Only load geometry inside a box around origin with 50x50 horizontal extent and 10 vertical extent.
      boundingBox: new THREE.Box3(new THREE.Vector3(75, 49, -100), new THREE.Vector3(125, 59, -50)),
      // Instruct Reveal that the coordinates already are relative to the coordinates of the model
      isBoundingBoxInModelCoordinates: true
    }
  });
  viewer.fitCameraToModel(model);
}
addFilteredModel();
```
