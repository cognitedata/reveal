# Document Search UI

This repo hosts the document classifiers frontend for the Unstructured Search API.

## Requirements

Configure your environment as described on [this Confluence page](https://cognitedata.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COG/pages/711950382/Nvm+npm+node+setup). This will give you the `nvm`, `npm` and `yarn` commands.

We currently use node version `12.19.0`. Ensure you are using this version by doing:

```
nvm install 12.19.0
nvm use 12.19.0
```

## Useful commands

### Build and run

```js
yarn
yarn start
```

### Testing

```js
yarn test
yarn test:once:unittests      # non-interactive, single run
```
