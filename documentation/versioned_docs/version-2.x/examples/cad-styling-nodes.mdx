import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/docs/components/DemoWrapper';

3D nodes may have associated attribute/property data. Reveal allows for filtering based on
these properties, allowing queries such as "all pipes", "nodes within module P600" or "nodes
with status S5". Combinations are also possible by using `UnionNodeCollection` and `IntersectionNodeCollection`.

`PropertyFilterNodeCollection` is used to query nodes based on node properties. It's possible to specify
multiple criterias which will be combined using `AND` - i.e. all criterias must be met for a node
to match. To emulate `OR`, use `UnionNodeCollection`.

Note that if a node is in a `PropertyFilterNodeCollection` all of its children will also be
in the set.

:::note
The test model used in the documentation site is lacking good node properties and the quality of 
the examples shown is therefor restricted as a result of this. To best utilize the filtering APIs 
we recommend providing a rich 3D models with a good set of high-quality attributes associated with 
the nodes.

## Show all pipes

If nodes in the 3D model has an attribute `'PDMS.Type'`, `PropertyFilterNodeCollection` can be used to
retrieve nodes of a certain type. In the following example, only pipes are accepted:

```js runnable-2x
// import { PropertyFilterNodeCollection, DefaultNodeAppearance } from '@cognite/reveal';

const allPipes = new PropertyFilterNodeCollection(sdk, model);
allPipes.executeFilter({'PDMS': {'Type': 'PIPE'}});
model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.assignStyledNodeCollection(allPipes, { renderGhosted: false, color: [40, 200, 20] } );
```

## Partitioning requests

For filters that match a lot of nodes, [paritioned requests](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#section/Parallel-retrieval)
might increase the performance radically by fetching result from the server in parallel.
To partition requests, provide the number of partitions using the `requestPartitions`-option
to the `PropertyFilterNodeCollection`-constructor:

```js runnable-2x
// import { PropertyFilterNodeCollection, DefaultNodeAppearance, NodeOutlineColor } from '@cognite/reveal';

const nodesFromFile = new PropertyFilterNodeCollection(sdk, model, { requestPartitions: 10 });
// All nodes originating from a given file
nodesFromFile.executeFilter({'Item': {'Source File': 'PRO-S_CD-MUM.rvm'}});
model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.assignStyledNodeCollection(nodesFromFile, { renderGhosted: false, outlineColor: NodeOutlineColor.Orange } );
```

To compare speed-up, set `requestPartitions` to `1`.

## Combining filters

Often one would want to match multiple criterias of the same type. Lets say we want to find all
mechanical equipment with purpose 'STU'. We can either execute this as a single query, or as two
seperate queries.

When doing this as a single query, no `IntersectionNodeCollection` is necessary and the code is quite compact:

```js runnable-2x
// import { PropertyFilterNodeCollection, DefaultNodeAppearance } from '@cognite/reveal';

const stuMechNodes = new PropertyFilterNodeCollection(sdk, model);
stuMechNodes.executeFilter({'PDMS': {':capDisc': 'MECH', 'Purpose': 'STU' }});

model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.assignStyledNodeCollection(stuMechNodes, { renderGhosted: false, color: [40, 200, 20] } );
```

Combining two separate queries requires the use of `IntersectionNodeCollection`:

```js runnable-2x
// import { PropertyFilterNodeCollection, IntersectionNodeCollection, DefaultNodeAppearance } from '@cognite/reveal';

const mechNodes = new PropertyFilterNodeCollection(sdk, model);
mechNodes.executeFilter({'PDMS': {':capDisc': 'MECH'}});

const stuNodes = new PropertyFilterNodeCollection(sdk, model);
stuNodes.executeFilter({'PDMS': {'Purpose': 'STU'}});

const combined = new IntersectionNodeCollection();
combined.add(mechNodes);
combined.add(stuNodes);

model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.assignStyledNodeCollection(combined, { renderGhosted: false, color: [40, 200, 20] } );
```

The two approaches has their pros and cons. Often it will be faster to combine the
filters into a single query as this will reduce the result set returned from the
server. However, if the different combinations will be configured run-time (e.g.
the user will want to show 'ARCH'-nodes within the 'STU'-purpose) it might
be better to use two separate queries and combine the results. Also, the latter
approach also allows for more complex types of filters.

## Matching nodes with a list of values

There might be situations where an application has a long list of identifiers of nodes to show
or style. In this case, `SinglePropertyFilterNodeCollection` might be useful. This class will match
one node property towards many values - e.g. a node identifier towards a list of IDs. This node set
supports thoushands of IDs - `PropertyFilterNodeCollection` only supports one matching value.

```js runnable-2x
// import { SinglePropertyFilterNodeCollection, DefaultNodeAppearance } from '@cognite/reveal';

const nodeSet = new SinglePropertyFilterNodeCollection(sdk, model, { requestPartitions: 10 });
const names = [];
for (let q = 200; q < 300; q++) {
  for (let e = 1; e <= 9; e++) {
    const name = `/60-EL-9016-Q${q}-E0${e}`;
    names.push(name);
  }
}
nodeSet.executeFilter('Item', 'Name', names);

model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.assignStyledNodeCollection(nodeSet, { renderGhosted: false, outlineColor: NodeOutlineColor.Orange } );
```

## Inverting filters

Often it is interesting to invert results from filters to find elements that does not match the query. This
can be done using `InvertedNodeCollection`.

```js runnable-2x
// import { PropertyFilterNodeCollection, InvertedNodeCollection, DefaultNodeAppearance } from '@cognite/reveal';

const livingQuarters = new PropertyFilterNodeCollection(sdk, model);
livingQuarters.executeFilter({'Item': {'Name': '/SLP/S/LQ'}});
const notLivingQuarters = new InvertedNodeCollection(model, livingQuarters);

model.setDefaultNodeAppearance({ 
  outlineColor: NodeOutlineColor.Red, 
  color: [120, 50, 0] 
});
model.assignStyledNodeCollection(notLivingQuarters, { 
  outlineColor: NodeOutlineColor.NoOutline, 
  color: [0,0,0] 
});
```
