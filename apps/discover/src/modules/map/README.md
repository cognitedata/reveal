## How to update map styling

1. Log into [mapbox studio accout](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signin/) (cognite account)
2. Change styling of the `Discover` map
3. Publish the changes (preferably as a new map) or else the changes are will effect the map at once
4. Copy the new style id to `MAPBOX_MAP_ID` located in `modules/map/constants`
