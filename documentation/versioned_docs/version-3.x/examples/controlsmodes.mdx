Reveal allows you to use different camera controls modes. You can set different controls modes using `setCameraControlsOptions` method of `Cognite3DViewer` class in runtime. Configurable parameters are described in `CameraControlsOptions` type (see API Reference for details). 

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" />

#### Mouse wheel action
Property `mouseWheelAction` describes what happens when user initiate a mouse wheel scroll. Possible valuses are:

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `zoomToTarget` | zooms just to the current target (center of the screen) of the camera. |
| `zoomPastCursor` |  zooms in the direction of the ray coming from camera through cursor screen position, allows going through objects. |
| `zoomToCursor` | mouse wheel scroll zooms towards the point on the model where cursor is hovering over, doesn't allow going through objects. |

Default value is `zoomPastCursor`.
   
#### On click camera target change  

Property `changeCameraTargetOnClick` enables or disables camera target change based on mouse clicks. When enabled, mouse click sets camera target to the point on the model where cursor is hovering over.

Default value is `false`.

Example of setting different camera controls options:

```jsx runnable-3x
const newControlsOptions = {
  mouseWheelAction: 'zoomToCursor',
  changeCameraTargetOnClick: true,
};

viewer.cameraManager.setCameraControlsOptions(newControlsOptions);
```
