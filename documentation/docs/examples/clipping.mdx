title: Clipping/slicing planes
describe: Reveal support adding a number of slicing planes to "cut through" the models.

Slicing planes, also called clipping planes, can be used to "cut through" the model to reveal the interior. This is 
useful to isolate interesting parts of the model and hide obscuring geometry. Reveal supports having multiple slicing planes
in arbitrary position and orientation. When slicing planes are active,
the amount of geometry loaded might be reduced since culled geometry doesn't need
to be loaded (or rather loaded in a lower detail level).

Clipping planes are currently not supported by point cloud models.

## Examples

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" />

### Single, fixed slicing plane

Slicing planes are defined by providing zero or more [`THREE.Plane`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Plane) 
to `Cognite3DViewer.setSlicingPlanes`. The slicing planes are activated for all models and
replaces any active slicing planes.

Typically, [setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint)
is used to create slicing planes. This function accepts a direction that defines the orientation of
the plane and a point on the plane. For example will the following
code create a slicing plane that only accepts geometry below `Y = 55`:
```jsx runnable
const orientation = new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0);
const point = new THREE.Vector3(0, 55, 0);
const plane = new THREE.Plane().setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, point);
viewer.setSlicingPlanes([plane]);
```

### Animated slicing plane

Planes can be manipulated runtime and effects will have effect in the viewer. Note however that rendering must be 
triggered after updating the plane before the change will have visual effect. This can be done using 
`Cognite3DViewer.forceRerender()`.

Below is an example animates a slicing plane by ping-ponging the plane in the vertical direction.

```js runnable
const bbox = model.getModelBoundingBox();

const orientation = new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0);
const point = new THREE.Vector3(0, bbox.max.y, 0);
const plane = new THREE.Plane();
plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, point);
viewer.setSlicingPlanes([plane]);

const start = performance.now();
setInterval(() => {
  // Ping-pong plane between top of model and half-way to the bottom
  const dt = (performance.now() - start) / 1000.0
  const s = 0.5 * (Math.sin(Math.PI * dt / 10.0) + 1.0);
  point.y = bbox.max.y - (bbox.max.y - bbox.min.y) / 2.0 * s;
  plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, point);

  viewer.forceRerender();
}, 1000 / 60);
```
:::info
Updating `THREE.Plane`-instances will not trigger data loading. Typically you will need to trigger data loading if
you do substantial changes to the slicing planes. In these cases, use `Cognite3DViewer.setSlicingPlanes`. The example 
above performs substantial changes to the planes without loading data. In a real application it's recommended to 
not load data during animation, but initiate data after an animation is completed.

### CAD geometry filter

```js runnable
// import { DragControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/DragControls';

const bounds = model.getModelBoundingBox();

// Create draggable cone at center of bounds
const center = bounds.getCenter(new THREE.Vector3());
var geometry = new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry(10, 10, 10);
var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 'green' }));
mesh.position.copy(center);
viewer.addObject3D(mesh);

// Prepare a clipping plane
const orientation = new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0);
const point = new THREE.Vector3(0, center.y, 0);
const plane = new THREE.Plane();
plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, point);
viewer.setSlicingPlanes([plane]);

const controls = new DragControls([mesh], viewer.getCamera(), viewer.domElement);
controls.addEventListener('drag', () => {
  // Fix XZ-poistion
  mesh.position.set(center.x, mesh.position.y, center.z);
  // Update slicing plane
  plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0), mesh.position);
  viewer.forceRerender();
});
controls.addEventListener('dragstart', () => viewer.cameraControlsEnabled = false);
controls.addEventListener('dragend', () => viewer.cameraControlsEnabled = true);
```
