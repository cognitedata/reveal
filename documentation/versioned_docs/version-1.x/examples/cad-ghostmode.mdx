"Ghosting" can be used to make parts of the model appear transparent and with a fixed color to highlight
other objects and provide context for location. Reveal supports toggling ghosting of CAD models using
`Cognite3DModel.ghostNodeByTreeindex` and `Cognite3DModel.unghostNodeByTreeIndex`. In addition, ghosting
for all nodes can be toggled using `Cognite3DModel.ghostAllNodes` and `Cognite3DModel.unghostAllNodes`.

## Examples

<DemoWrapper />

### Ghost model to identify the location of a piece of equipment

A typical use case for ghosting is to show the location of a piece of equipment. To do this,
first ghost all nodes and un-ghost the relevant nodes.

```jsx runnable-1x
model.ghostAllNodes();
model.unghostNodeByTreeIndex(409228, applyToChildren=true);
```

### Picking in ghost mode

When nodes are ghosted, they are not clickable and the user will be able to click nodes that otherwise
would be occluded by the ghosted nodes.

In this example, equipment is made visible through a ghosted model. When the user clicks the equipment
the other nodes are hidden and the camera is zoomed in to the equipment.

```jsx runnable-1x
const treeIndex = 409228;

model.showAllNodes();
model.ghostAllNodes();
model.unghostNodeByTreeIndex(treeIndex, applyToChildren=true);

viewer.on('click', event => {
  const intersection = viewer.getIntersectionFromPixel(
    event.offsetX, event.offsetY
  );
  if (intersection) {
    const bboxPromise = model.getBoundingBoxByTreeIndex(treeIndex);

    model.hideAllNodes();
    model.unghostAllNodes();
    model.showNodeByTreeIndex(treeIndex, applyToChildren=true);

    bboxPromise.then(bbox => {
      viewer.fitCameraToBoundingBox(bbox);
    });
  };
});
```

### Performance remarks

Note that rendering performance might be affected by enabling ghost mode. Especially if only a few objects are ghosted there might be a considerable
performance degradation as the rendering pipeline is optimized for either no ghosted objects or that most of the objects in the 3D model are ghosted.

To ensure the best performance, follow these guidelines:
- Ghost most of the model or no objects in the model. Ghosting just a few objects will decrease performance considerably
- Prefer hiding nodes over ghosting when possible
