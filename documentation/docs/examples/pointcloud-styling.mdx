description: Usage of the styling API for pointcloud models

Cognite Data Fusion has a concept of "objects" in point clouds, represented by one or more bounding volumes for
each object. The objects are backed by the [CDF Annotations API](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#tag/Annotations) or [CDF CognitePointCloudVolume](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/dm/dm_reference/dm_core_data_model/#cognitepointcloudvolume).
Reveal supports styling individual objects within a point cloud.

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/docs/components/DemoWrapper';

<DemoWrapper modelType="pointcloud" />

In this context, a _stylable object_ is represented by a volume in space. Styling an object results in all points that lie within the corresponding volume to attain the assigned style.

Stylable objects must be supplied separately from the model itself. Upon adding a new point cloud model to the viewer, Reveal will automatically fetch data describing the point cloud objects from CDF's Annotations API or CDF's CognitePointCloudVolume, if any are available.
To get the number of fetched stylable objects, use the property `model.stylableObjectCount`, where `model` is a `CognitePointCloudModel`.

After the model and associated stylable objects are loaded, you may list the objects using `model.stylableObjects`. This contains all stylable objects as instances of `PointCloudObjectMetadata`, containing the following fields for CDF's Annotations:

| Field                      | Field type                      | Description                                                                           |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `annotationId`             | `number`                        | The ID of the CDF annotation that this stylable object corresponds to.                |
| `assetRef`                 | `AnnotationsAssetRef?`          | A reference to an asset. Either the internal ID or the external ID, if any.           |
| `boundingBox`              | `THREE.Box3`                    | The bounding box of the stylable object in Reveal space.                              |

And contains following fields for CDF's `CognitePointCloudVolume`

| Field                      | Field type                      | Description                                                                           |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `volumeInstanceRef`        | `DMInstanceRef`                 | Reference to the `CognitePointCloudVolume`. It consists of a space and an external Id.|
| `assetRef`                 | `DMInstanceRef?`                | Reference to the `CogniteAsset`. It consists of a space and an external Id, if any.   |
| `boundingBox`              | `THREE.Box3`                    | The bounding box of the stylable object in Reveal space.                              |

To visualize all bounding boxes associated with the stylable objects:

```js runnable
const boxGroup = new THREE.Group();

model.stylableObjects.forEach(obj => boxGroup.add(new THREE.Box3Helper(obj.boundingBox)));

viewer.addObject3D(boxGroup);
```

Point cloud objects can be styled with a `PointCloudAppearance` object, containing the following attributes:

| Field                      | Field type                      | Description                                                                           |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `color`                    | `THREE.Color?`                  | Override color. If all components equal to zero, the override is unused.              |
| `visible`                  | `boolean?`                      | When false, stylable object will be invisible. Default value is `true`.               |

To assign a style to one or more stylable objects, you must first create an instance of the abstract class `PointCloudAnnotationVolumeCollection`.
The `AnnotationIdPointCloudObjectCollection` class can be used for CDF's Annotations, which is initialized with a list of annotation IDs corresponding to stylable objects.

The `PointCloudDMVolumeCollection` class can be used for styling with CDF's Core datamodel CognitePointCloudVolume, which is initialized with a list of DM references.
To see all available annotation IDs or point cloud volume references associated with the model, you may use the `model.stylableObjects`.

To color all stylable objects green for annotation IDs:

```js runnable
const annotationIds = [];

model.stylableObjects.forEach(objectMetadata => annotationIds.push(objectMetadata.annotationId));

const objectCollection = new AnnotationIdPointCloudObjectCollection(annotationIds);
const appearance = { color: new THREE.Color(0, 1, 0) };

model.assignStyledObjectCollection(objectCollection, appearance);
```

To color all stylable objects blue for point cloud volume references:
```jsx
const pointCloudVolumeRefs = [];

model.stylableObjects.forEach(objectMetadata => {
  if (isDMPointCloudVolume(objectMetadata))
    pointCloudVolumeRefs.push(objectMetadata.volumeInstanceRef);
});

const objectCollection = new PointCloudDMVolumeCollection(pointCloudVolumeRefs);
const appearance = { color: new THREE.Color(0, 0, 1) };

model.assignStyledObjectCollection(objectCollection, appearance);
```

After assigning style to an object collection, you may use the property `model.styledCollections` to get a list of all object collections and their assigned styles registered on the model.

## Default appearance

It is also possible to set a default appearance for the point cloud using the `model.setDefaultPointCloudAppearance`. The following example makes all annotated objects visible, while hiding everything else:

```js runnable
const annotationIds = [];

model.stylableObjects.forEach(annotationMetadata => annotationIds.push(annotationMetadata.annotationId));

const objectCollection = new AnnotationIdPointCloudObjectCollection(annotationIds);
const appearance = { visible: true };

model.assignStyledObjectCollection(objectCollection, appearance);
model.setDefaultPointCloudAppearance({ visible: false });
```

For Cognite core data model point cloud model
```jsx
const pointCloudVolumeRefs = [];

model.stylableObjects.forEach(objectMetadata => {
  if (isDMPointCloudVolume(objectMetadata))
    pointCloudVolumeRefs.push(objectMetadata.volumeInstanceRef);
});

const objectCollection = new PointCloudDMVolumeCollection(pointCloudVolumeRefs);
const appearance = { visible: true };

model.assignStyledObjectCollection(objectCollection, appearance);
model.setDefaultPointCloudAppearance({ visible: false });
```

Like in CAD styling, stylable objects that are part of multiple styled object collections will attain the appearance of the object set whose first style assignment was last.

## Unassigning styled object collections

To reset style of an object collection, use `model.unassignStyledObjectCollection` with the previously styled `PointCloudAnnotationVolumeCollection` as argument. To reset all styled objects use `model.removeAllStyledCollections`

## Reset all styled object collections

To reset all styled object collections, use the method `model.removeAllStyledObjectCollections()`.

This example removes all style on stylable object collections and makes sure the rest of the point cloud is visible.
```js runnable
model.removeAllStyledObjectCollections();
model.setDefaultPointCloudAppearance({ visible: true });
```

## Point cloud shapes

Currently, the only supported shapes that constitute point cloud objects are cylinders and boxes. The specification for how this data is stored, can be found in the [API documentation for Retrieve Annotation](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#tag/Annotations/operation/annotationsGet) under Responses -> 200 Successful retrieval -> `data` -> `pointcloud.BoundingVolume`.
And for Cognite core data model refer CognitePointCloudVolume.

Note that Reveal will visualize the shapes with a somewhat larger size than how they are stored, as to make sure that all points that lie on the surface of the objects also are included as parts of it.
