The library has peer-dependencies on [Cognite Data Fusion JS-SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cognite/sdk)
and [ThreeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three) which must be installed as dependencies in the client application that uses Reveal.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @cognite/reveal @cognite/sdk three@<version>
```

Please find the correct version of ThreeJS in [the release documentation on Github](https://github.com/cognitedata/reveal/releases/). We only guarantee support for the exact ThreeJS version specified there.
