### Steps

1. Install package dependencies in the root of the monorepo:
   ```
   yarn
   ```
2. Navigate to the sub-app and start local development server
   ```
   cd apps/data-exploration
   yarn start
   ```
2. Navigate to [dev.fusion.cogniteapp.com](dev.fusion.cogniteapp.com)
3. Run `importMapOverrides.enableUI()` in the console
4. Click the <img width="32" valign="bottom" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6615090/165697621-dc80186c-2bdc-4f1c-90a1-d7ab4f985efc.png"> button that appears in the bottom right corner
5. Find `@cognite/cdf-data-exploration` module name and click on the row including it

For the libraries illustrated in the attachment, we can briefly explain the concern as follows:

* Core ‚Äì general utilities, constants, functions, etc‚Ä¶ that are used by the other libraries
* Domain layer ‚Äì network/data layer, fetching and handing the internal and external state of data management
* Components ‚Äì dumb components, base components that should not have any hooks/domain logic, just UI representation
* Containers ‚Äì take components, domain layer, hooks, etc‚Ä¶ and create ‚Äúsmart‚Äù components that are consumed by apps.

... and the application itself (data-explorer) is just concerned about managing the global state, the routing and general layout of the application. Most bulk of the logic lives in the libraries! 

> NOTE: We are currently undergoing a refactoring of moving logic and components from 'libs/data-exploration-components' into the respective sub-libraries inside of 'libs/data-exploration' -- please refrain from adding new login into the old folder.


## Troubleshooting

### I get "Refused to load the script `https://localhost:3010/index.js"` error when I apply a subapp override

1.  Open `https://localhost:3010/index.js` in a new tab.
2.  Ignore the security warning and click ‚ÄúProceed to site‚Äù.
3.  Go back to dev.fusion.cogniteapp.com and refresh üîÑ

To avoid doing this multiple times, enable this flag on Chrome:
[chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost](chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost)
