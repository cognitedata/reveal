Create react package
==========================
Set up a react package boilerplate by running one command. 

## Quick overview
To access Cognite private npm packages, like this one, you need to have 2-factor authentication enabled for both authentication and publish. You can then ask to be invited to the @cognite scope on npm. Please see: https://cog.link/javascript-and-nodejs.
```
npx @cognite/create-react-package my-package
cd my-package
yarn
```

## Contents
Now in your newly created directory you have:
- Full package build configuration
- Scripts to publish your package to npm
- Your first component boilerplate
- Jest + Enzyme tests configuration
- Storybooks
- Typescript
- Linters and prettier
- License and Code of conduct
- Fully setup CI with Jenkins
- PR-server storybook deployment
