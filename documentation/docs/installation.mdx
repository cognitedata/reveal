The library has peer-dependencies on [Cognite Data Fusion JS-SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cognite/sdk)
and [ThreeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three) which must be installed as dependencies in the client application that uses Reveal.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @cognite/reveal @cognite/sdk three@<version>
```

Please find the correct version of ThreeJS in [the release documentation on Github](https://github.com/cognitedata/reveal/releases/). We only guarantee support for the exact ThreeJS version specified there.

## Installation for projects with Content-Security-Policy

To be able to use Reveal while having a CSP you have to allow the following:
* [script-src](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) `unsafe-eval`
* [connect-src](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/connect-src) `data:`

These settings are nessesary to allow for execution of internal WebAssembly modules bundled with Reveal.
The `connect-src` policy is for allowing the WebAssembly module to be added as [data url](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs).
The `unsafe-eval` policy is needed to evaluate and execute the WebAssembly module at runtime.
This may be removed in the future once the [wasm-unsafe-eval](https://github.com/WebAssembly/content-security-policy/blob/master/proposals/CSP.md) policy gets implemented into all major browsers.

:::note
Evaluate security risks before adding any of these options to your CSP.
