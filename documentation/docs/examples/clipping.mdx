describe: Reveal support adding a number of slicing planes to "cut through" the models.

Slicing planes, also called clipping planes, can be used to "cut through" the model to reveal the interior. This is 
useful to isolate interesting parts of the model and hide obscuring geometry. Reveal supports having multiple slicing planes
in arbitrary position and orientation. When slicing planes are active,
the amount of geometry loaded might be reduced since culled geometry doesn't need
to be loaded (or rather loaded in a lower detail level).

Clipping planes are currently not supported by point cloud models.

## Examples

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" />

### Single, fixed slicing plane

Slicing planes are defined by providing zero or more [`THREE.Plane`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Plane) 
to `Cognite3DViewer.setSlicingPlanes`. The slicing planes are activated for all models and
replaces any active slicing planes.

Typically, [setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint)
is used to create slicing planes. This function accepts a direction that defines the orientation of
the plane and a point on the plane. For example will the following
code create a slicing plane that only accepts geometry below `Y = 55`:
```jsx runnable
const point = new THREE.Vector3(0, 55, 0);
const orientation = new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0);
const plane = new THREE.Plane().setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, point);
viewer.setSlicingPlanes([plane]);
```
