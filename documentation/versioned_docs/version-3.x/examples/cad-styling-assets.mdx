describe: Applying styles to assets and assosciated asset mappings from Cognite Fusion

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/versioned_docs/version-3.x/components/DemoWrapper';

In Cognite Data Fusion, assets and asset hierarchies are digital representations of objects
or groups of objects from the physical world. Assets can be assosciated with different data 
types, such as documents, time series and events and serves as a "hub" to look up data for
physical equipment. See [Cognite Data Fusion documentation](https://docs.cognite.com/dev/concepts/resource_types/assets.html)
for more information about assets.

3D nodes can be ["asset mapped"](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#tag/3D-Asset-Mapping) to
assets in Cognite Data Fusion. Reveal supports styling nodes mapped to an asset by using 
`AssetNodeCollection`.

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" />

# Style all asset mapped nodes

If no options are provided, `AssetNodeCollection` includes all asset mapped nodes
for the model:

```js runnable-3x
const allAssetMappedNodes = new AssetNodeCollection(sdk, model);
// When no asset ID is provided, all nodes mapped to assets are included
allAssetMappedNodes.executeFilter({});
model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.assignStyledNodeCollection(allAssetMappedNodes, { renderGhosted: false, outlineColor: NodeOutlineColor.Cyan } );
```

# Style a given asset

It is also possible to only style nodes mapped to a single asset. Assets are identified by their 
'ID':

```js runnable-3x
const assetNodes = new AssetNodeCollection(sdk, model);
assetNodes.executeFilter({ assetId: 4222791488928479 });
model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.assignStyledNodeCollection(assetNodes, { renderGhosted: false, outlineColor: NodeOutlineColor.Cyan } );
```

Note that there is no way to list multiple assets directly with `AssetNodeCollection`, but This
can be achieved by using `UnionNodeCollection` in combination with several `AssetNodeCollection`s.

# Style assets within an area

To support proximity lookups, Reveal supports styling assets within a certain area defined by a bounding box. It's
sufficient for an asset to intersect the provided bounds, it doesn't need to be fully inside.

:::note
The bounding box is defined in "Reveal coordinates" - 
[a right handed, Y up coordinate system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGbMzoJqV7c) - which might differ 
from the "native model coordinates" stored in Cognite Fusion. `AssetNodeCollection` will automatically map from 
"Reveal coordinates" to "native model coordinates" using `Cognite3DModel.mapBoxFromModelToCdfCoordinates`.

```js runnable-3x
const areaOfInterest = new THREE.Box3().setFromCenterAndSize(
  new THREE.Vector3(140, 67, -110),
  new THREE.Vector3(10, 5, 10)
);
const assetsWithinAreaNodes = new AssetNodeCollection(sdk, model);
assetsWithinAreaNodes.executeFilter({ boundingBox: areaOfInterest });
model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Hidden);
model.assignStyledNodeCollection(assetsWithinAreaNodes, { visible: true } );

// Simple helper to show the area of interest
const boxMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({wireframe: true, color: 0xffff00 });
const boxMesh = new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.BoxGeometry(), boxMaterial);
areaOfInterest.getCenter(boxMesh.position);
areaOfInterest.getSize(boxMesh.scale);
viewer.addObject3D(boxMesh);
```
