The library depends on [ThreeJS](https://www.threejs.org/) which must be installed as a dependency in the client application. Note that we 
recommend that the ThreeJS version matches the version used in Reveal as there can be breaking changes between each ThreeJS version.

You will also need to install [@cognite/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cognite/sdk) - the Cognite Fusion SDK.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @cognite/reveal @cognite/sdk three@0.125.0
```

If you are developing in TypeScript it's also recommended to install types for ThreeJS:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @types/three@.125.0
```

Reveal uses [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) to handle 3D geometry. This causes some problems when bundling and loading packages from NPM. Some effort might therefor be needed before Reveal can be used in your project depending on the servers hosting your application are configured.

There are two different types of deployment scenarios:

1. Projects where Cognite [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)
`apps-cdn.cognitedata.com` is available
(no restrictive [`Content-Security-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)-headers are set, or apps-cdn is whitelisted)

2. Projects with [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
that forbids to fetch scripts from `apps-cdn.cognitedata.com`.

By default, Reveal will try to fetch its worker/WASM files from `apps-cdn.cognitedata.com`.
If there are no CSP in your project that forbids that, Reveal should work out of the box without any additional steps.

In case if you see an error like the following in your development console:

> Refused to load the script 'https://apps-cdn.cognitedata.com/@cognite/reveal-parser-worker@1.1.0/reveal.parser.worker.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' https://localhost:* blob:"

See the steps below.

## Installation for projects with Content-Security-Policy

What you'll need to do is to host worker/wasm files at some server from which your browser can download and run js code.

Before going with any of the steps below, consider to just whitelist Cognite CDN in your Content-Security-Policy.
All you need to do is to add into your CSP:
* [script-src](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) `apps-cdn.cognitedata.com`
* [worker-src](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/worker-src) `blob:` (only the first option described below doesn't need `worker-src blob:`)


Also, notice that because Safari browser [doesn't support](https://caniuse.com/#search=instantiateStreaming)
`WebAssembly.InstantiateStreaming` yet, so it uses `WebAssembly.instantiate` which requires
`script-src: unsafe-eval` to be presented in CSP. Evaluate security risks before adding `unsafe-eval` to your CSP.

If whitelisting of `apps-cdn.cognitedata.com` is not an options for you, go with one of the steps below.

<!-- check the anchor links if change this title -->
### Option 1: include Web Worker and WebAssembly files as static assets in your project

Copy all files from `/node_modules/@cognite/reveal-parser-worker/dist/local`
to some static folder in your project. E.g., for React projects, the typical folder is `/public`.

You can add this command to your build scripts:

```
cp ./node_modules/@cognite/reveal-parser-worker/dist/local/* ./public/reveal-worker
```

The point is that parser-worker files should be available under some network path
like in that case `https://localhost:xxxx/reveal-worker/reveal.parser.worker.js` if you can see
script content in your browser you're almost done.

The only thing left is to tell the reveal library from which path workers should be fetched.
To do that, use `revealEnv`:

```js
import { revealEnv, Cognite3DViewer } from '@cognite/reveal';
revealEnv.publicPath = `/reveal-worker/`;

// ... then use reveal normally ...
const viewer = new Cognite3DViewer(/*...*/)
```

    <summary>Other copying options</summary>

  Below are few more convenient options for copying if you don't like having that command in your package.json:

```bash
  cp ./node_modules/@cognite/reveal-parser-worker/dist/local/* ./public/reveal-worker
```

#### Option 1.1: Copy worker files locally in a create-react-app based project

1. Install [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired). It's required to slightly modify react-scripts from create-react-app without running `eject`

    ```bash npm2yarn
    npm install react-app-rewired --save-dev
    ```

1. 'Flip' the existing calls to `react-scripts` in `npm` scripts for start, build and test

   ```diff title="/package.json"
     "scripts": {
   -   "start": "react-scripts start",
   +   "start": "react-app-rewired start",
   -   "build": "react-scripts build",
   +   "build": "react-app-rewired build",
   -   "test": "react-scripts test",
   +   "test": "react-app-rewired test",
       "eject": "react-scripts eject"
   }
   ```

1. Install [copy-webpack-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/copy-webpack-plugin/)

   ```bash npm2yarn
    npm install copy-webpack-plugin --save-dev
    ```

1. Create a `config-overrides.js` file in the root directory with the following content

    ```javascript title="./config-overrides.js"
    const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

    const revealSource = 'node_modules/@cognite/reveal';

    module.exports = function override(config) {
      if (!config.plugins) {
        // eslint-disable-next-line no-param-reassign
        config.plugins = [];
      }

      // that's for 6.x version of webpack-copy-plugin
      // if you use 5.x just put content of patterns into constructor
      // new CopyWebpackPlugin([ /* { from, to } */ ])
      config.plugins.push(
        new CopyWebpackPlugin({
          patterns: [
            {
              from: `${revealSource}/**/*.worker.js`,
              to: '.',
              flatten: true,
            },
            {
              from: `${revealSource}/**/*.wasm`,
              to: '.',
              flatten: true,
            },
          ],
        })
      );

      return config;
    };
    ```

Now all `*.worker.js` and `*.wasm` files from `@cognite/reveal` should be copied into your output folder when you run build.

#### Option 1.2: Copy worker files locally for non-create-react-app based projects

Just make sure that you have `*.worker.js` and `*.wasm` files from `@cognite/reveal` in your output folder.

If you use webpack, you might want to add [copy-webpack-plugin@^5.1.1](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/copy-webpack-plugin/)
in your `webpack.config.js`

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
const revealSource = 'node_modules/@cognite/reveal';

{
  /* ... */
  plugins: [
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [
        {
          from: `${revealSource}/**/*.worker.js`,
          to: '.',
          flatten: true,
        },
        {
          from: `${revealSource}/**/*.wasm`,
          to: '.',
          flatten: true,
        },
      ],
    })
  ]
}
```

  </details>

### Option 2: host Web Worker and WebAssembly files externally

In case if there is no such `/public` or similar folder in your project, you're likely using a different service
to host static assets. The domain of that service is probably whitelisted in Content Security Policy and can be used to host the necessary files.

In that case, the only thing you can do is to build the reveal-parser-worker from sources with correct `publicPath`.

Let's say your static server has that URL `https://static.server/` and you can upload the files
at some folder, e.g. `parser-worker` folder. So files should be available at `https://static.server/parser-worker/`

Then all you need to do is:

1. Clone or download [@cognite/reveal](https://github.com/cognitedata/reveal).
2. `cd ./reveal/parser-worker`
3. Consult `parser-worker/README.md` and install the necessary build tools
4. You will need to set `PUBLIC_PATH` env variable that points at your static server.
Run the build with that env variable. You will see the `publicPath` printed to console during the build.

<Tabs
  groupId="operating-systems"
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    {label: 'Bash', value: 'bash'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```bash
PUBLIC_PATH="https://static.server/parser-worker/" yarn build:prod
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="win">

```bash
set PUBLIC_PATH="https://static.server/parser-worker/" && yarn build:prod
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you set the environment variable correctly, you should see it printed to console during the build:

```log
> ⬡ <webpack-log>: Worker local build config:
> ⬡ <webpack-log>:  { publicPath: 'https://static.server/parser-worker/' }
```

5. Take the files from `./parser-worker/dist/local` and host them on your CDN at the path you specified – `https://static.server/parser-worker/`.

6. In your project, specify `revealEnv.publicPath`

```js
import { revealEnv, Cognite3DViewer } from '@cognite/reveal';
revealEnv.publicPath = `https://static.server/parser-worker/`;

// ... then use reveal normally ...
const viewer = new Cognite3DViewer(/*...*/)
```

Everything should work fine now.

### A note on Content-type header for .wasm files

:::tip important
Make sure your server sends `*.wasm` files with `Content-type: application/wasm` header.
:::

Sometimes servers don't have correct MIME type set for wasm files.
In that case you might notice this message in a browser console when it fetches a `.wasm` file:

> Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to execute 'compile' on 'WebAssembly': Incorrect response MIME type. Expected 'application/wasm'.

In that case you'll need to configure your server to set the `Content-type: application/wasm` header for `*.wasm` files.
If you use the nginx add [types](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#types) in the config
or edit the [mime.types file](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/#mime-types).

```types title="/mime.types"
types {
    application/wasm wasm;
}
```
