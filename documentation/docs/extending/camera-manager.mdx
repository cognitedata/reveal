By default `Cognite3DViewer` uses `DefaultCameraManager` class to manage user interaction with the camera.
In certain cases it can be useful to customize behaviour of the camera:

- Need to provide custom `THREE.PerspectiveCamera` object to `Cognite3DViewer`
- Need to extend camera controls to any specific case that is not covered by current implementation


## Overview

To create a custom camera manager class, `CameraManager` interface from `@cognite/reveal` must be implemented
and provided to `Cognite3DViewer` on construction using the `cameraManager`-option. Interface looks like this:

```js
export interface CameraManager {
  /**
   * Returns the camera used for rendering in {@link Cognite3DViewer}.
   * Note that the camera will not be modified directly by Reveal.
   * Implementations must trigger the `cameraChange`-event whenever the
   * camera changes.
   */
  getCamera(): THREE.PerspectiveCamera;
  /**
   * Set camera's state. Rotation and target can't be set at the same time. as they could conflict,
   * should throw an error if both are passed with non-zero value inside state.
   *
   * @param state Camera state, all fields are optional.
   * @param state.position Camera position in world space.
   * @param state.target Camera target in world space.
   * @param state.rotation Camera local rotation in quaternion form.
   * @example
   * ```js
   * // store position, target
   * const { position, target } = cameraManager.getCameraState();
   * // restore position, target
   * cameraManager.setCameraState({ position, target });
   * ```
   */
  setCameraState(state: CameraState): void;

  /**
   * Get camera's state
   * @returns Camera state: position, target and rotation.
   */
  getCameraState(): Required<CameraState>;

  /**
   * Subscribes to changes of the camera event. This is used by Reveal to react on changes of the camera.
   * @param event Name of the event.
   * @param callback Callback to be called when the event is fired.
   */
  on(event: 'cameraChange', callback: CameraChangedEvent): void;
  /**
   * Unsubscribes from changes of the camera event.
   * @param event Name of the event.
   * @param callback Callback function to be unsubscribed.
   */
  off(event: 'cameraChange', callback: CameraChangedEvent): void;

  /**
   * Moves camera to a place where the content of a bounding box is visible to the camera.
   * @param box The bounding box in world space.
   * @param duration The duration of the animation moving the camera.
   * @param radiusFactor The ratio of the distance from camera to center of box and radius of the box.
   */
  fitCameraToBoundingBox(boundingBox: THREE.Box3, duration?: number, radiusFactor?: number): void;
  /**
   * Updates internal state of camera manager. Expected to update visual state of the camera
   * as well as it's near and far planes if needed. Called in `requestAnimationFrame`-loop.
   * Reveal performance affects frequency with which this method is called.
   * @param deltaTime Delta time since last update in seconds.
   * @param boundingBox Global bounding box of the model(s) and any custom objects added to the scene.
   */
  update(deltaTime: number, boundingBox: THREE.Box3): void;
  /**
   * @obvious
   */
  dispose(): void;
}

```

Main implementation specific functions are `setCameraState`, `fitCameraToBoundingBox` and `update`. 
Setting state shouldn't be possible when `rotation` and `target` are passed at the same time because they could conflict.
When implementing these functions you can use a helper class `CameraManagerHelper` that contains some useful methods.

## Example implementation

Here is an example implementation of a custom camera manager that utilizes standard ThreeJS [`OrbitControls`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=orbit#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls) for mouse movement:

```js
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls';

import { CameraManager, CameraManagerHelper, CameraState, CameraChangeDelegate } from '@cognite/reveal';

export class CustomCameraManager implements CameraManager {
    private _domElement: HTMLElement;
    private _camera: THREE.PerspectiveCamera;
    private _controls: OrbitControls;
    private readonly _cameraChangedListener: Array<CameraChangeDelegate> = [];

    constructor(domElement: HTMLElement, camera: THREE.PerspectiveCamera) {
        this._domElement = domElement;
        this._camera = camera;
        this._controls = new OrbitControls(this._camera, domElement);
        this._controls.enableDamping = true;
        this._controls.dampingFactor = 0.3;

        this._controls.addEventListener('change', () => {
            this._cameraChangedListener.forEach( cb => cb(this._camera.position, 
            this._controls.target));
        });
    }

    getCamera(): THREE.PerspectiveCamera {
        return this._camera;
    }

    setCameraState(state: CameraState): void {
        if (state.rotation && state.target) throw 
          new Error("Can't set both rotation and target");

        const position = state.position ?? this._camera.position;
        const rotation = state.rotation ?? this._camera.quaternion;
        const target = state.target ?? ( state.rotation ? 
            CameraManagerHelper.calculateNewTargetFromRotation(
                this._camera, state.rotation, this._controls.target) : 
            this._controls.target);

        this._camera.position.copy(position);
        this._controls.target.copy(target);
        this._camera.quaternion.copy(rotation);
    }

    getCameraState(): Required<CameraState> {
        return {
            position: this._camera.position.clone(),
            target: this._controls.target.clone(),
            rotation: this._camera.quaternion.clone(),
        }
    }

    on(event: "cameraChange", callback: CameraChangeDelegate): void {
        this._cameraChangedListener.push(callback);
    }

    off(event: "cameraChange", callback: CameraChangeDelegate): void {
        const index  = this._cameraChangedListener.indexOf(callback);
        if (index !== -1) {
            this._cameraChangedListener.splice(index, 1);
        }
    }

    fitCameraToBoundingBox(boundingBox: THREE.Box3, duration?: number, radiusFactor?: number): void {
        const { position, target } = CameraManagerHelper
          .calculateCameraStateToFitBoundingBox(this._camera, boundingBox, radiusFactor);

        this.setCameraState({ position, target });
    }

    update(deltaTime: number, boundingBox: THREE.Box3): void {
        this._controls.update();
        CameraManagerHelper.updateCameraNearAndFar(this._camera, boundingBox);
    }

    dispose(): void {
        this._controls.dispose();
        this._cameraChangedListener.splice(0);
    }
}
```
As you can see, implementation can be quite simple. There are three things that you should really pay extra attention to:
1. `'cameraChange'` event must be fired every time camera position or rotation changes to trigger redraw in Reveal.
2. For the `setCameraState` method you should properly handle how change in rotation and target affects the camera and corresponds with 
the behaviour of camera controls (`OrbitControls` in this case). For calculating camera target from rotation you can use `calculateNewTargetFromRotation` method of `CameraManagerHelper` .
3. Inside `update` method you should update `near` and `far` planes of the camera, which can be easily done using `updateCameraNearAndFar` method of `CameraManagerHelper`.
