Reveal has functions for iterating over CAD nodes, either all nodes in a 3D model or a subtree of a parent node.
Note that all functions are async, and the action that you pass is not applied immediately. A single model can
have millions of nodes. To avoid long blocking operations the action is applied in blocks, allowing for an
interactive page while the action is being applied.

## Iterate over all nodes

This example only demonstrates how iteration over model nodes performed gradually.

```jsx runnable
async function visitAllNodes() {
  let sum = 0;
  await model.iterateNodesByTreeIndex(treeIndex => sum = sum + treeIndex)
  alert('Iteration is done! Sum of all tree indexes is ' + sum);
}
visitAllNodes();
```

## Iterate over subtree nodes

`Cognite3DModel.iterateSubtreeByTreeIndex` iterates over all descendants of a node by tree index. The provided
tree index is included in the set of visited nodes. The following example sets the color of all descendants of
a node. This mimics the functionality of `Cognite3DModel.setNodesColorsByTreeIndex` with `applyToChildren`
set to `true`.

```jsx runnable
async function visitSubtree() {
  let sum = 0;
  await model.iterateSubtreeByTreeIndex(917985, treeIndex => sum = sum + treeIndex);
  alert('Iteration is done! Sum of all tree indexes in subtree is ' + sum);
}
visitSubtree();
```
