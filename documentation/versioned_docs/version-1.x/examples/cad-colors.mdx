Reveal supports updating the color of individual objects by providing [tree indices to identify 3D nodes](../concepts.md).

<DemoWrapper />

## Update all node colors

To update the colors of all nodes, loop over all tree indices in the model and update the colors
accordingly:

```jsx runnable-1x
model.iterateNodesByTreeIndex(treeIndex => {
  const value = treeIndex % 200;
  model.setNodeColorByTreeIndex(treeIndex, 200, value, 200);
});
```

> ** New in 1.1.0 **

Notice how colors are applied in batches using this approach. A more performant choice when a single color is
to be applied to all nodes is to use `Cognite3DModel.setAllNodeColors`:

```jsx runnable-1x
model.setAllNodeColors(127, 127, 127);
```

## Reset node colors

Color overrides can be reset using `Cognite3DModel.resetNodeColorByTreeIndex`, e.g.

```jsx runnable-1x
model.iterateNodesByTreeIndex(treeIndex => {
  model.resetNodeColorByTreeIndex(treeIndex);
});
```

It's also possible (and more performant) to use `Cognite3DModel.resetAllNodeColors()` when
you want to reset the colors of all nodes:

```jsx runnable-1x
model.resetAllNodeColors();
```

## Update the colors of a subtree

The 3D nodes are organized in a tree structure, where e.g. equipment will have many sub-components. In
order to update the colors of equipment it's typically necessary to apply the same color to the entire
subtree. Reveal supports this through the use of `Cognite3DModel.setNodesColorsByTreeIndex` with `applyToChildren`
set to `true`:

```jsx runnable-1x
model.setNodeColorByTreeIndex(778306, 240, 100, 60, applyToChildren=true);
```
