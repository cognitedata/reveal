# data-exploration-components

## Using the library

To use the `@cognite/data-exploration` library, check out the [storybook](https://cognitedata.github.io/data-exploration-components/).

## Developing locally

You should use storybook as much as possible for local development.
```
yarn storybook
```

Alternatively, if you want to develop `data-exploration-components` locally with `data-exploration` subapp:

1. Install yalc:
```
yarn global add yalc
```

2. In data-exploration-components package:
```
yarn build
yalc publish
```

3. In data-exploration subapp:
```
yalc add @cognite/data-exploration
yarn
```

To develop simultaneously:

In data-exploration-components package:
```
yarn watch
```

In data-exploration subapp:
```
yarn start
```

Now the changes made in data-exploration components should trigger a reload of data-exploration.
