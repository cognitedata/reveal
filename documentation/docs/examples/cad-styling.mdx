describe: Reveal supports styling individual nodes by assigning appearance profiles.

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/src/components/DemoWrapper';

Reveal supports flexible styling of individual nodes (objects) in the 3D model. Styles can
be compromised of several attributes to customize the visualization through the `NodeApperance`-type:

| Field           | Field type                  | Description                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `color`         | `[number, number, number]?` | Override color by setting RGB values in range [0,255] |
| `visible`       | `boolean?`                  | When false, the node(s) will be invisible             |
| `renderInFront` | `boolean?`                  | When true, the node(s) are rendered in front of other geometry |
| `renderGhosted` | `boolean?`                  | When true, the node(s) are rendered in transparent gray |
| `outlineColor`  | `NodeOutlineColor?`         | Adds an outline to the objects from a set of predefined colors |

These attributes can be combined to customize the look of nodes. For convinience, a set of default apperances are
provided in the `DefaultNodeApperance`-constant:

| Apperance           | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Default`           | No overrides, use colors from the CAD model                                      |
| `Ghosted`           | Render node(s) 'ghosted', i.e. make them translucent gray                        |
| `Outlined`          | Outline node(s) with a white outline                                             |
| `Hidden`            | Hide node(s)                                                                     |
| `InFront`           | Render node(s) in front of all other nodes                                       |
| `Highlighted`       | Highlight the node(s). Combination of `InFront`, `Outlined` and a custom color   |

These "appearance profiles"/styles are assigned to one or more nodes defined by a `NodeSet`-object. A `NodeSet` 
identifies 3D nodes by `treeIndex`. There are several implementations of `NodeSet`:

| Class                    |                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ByTreeIndexNodeSet`     | A set of nodes defined by a list of tree indices. Can be updated with a new set list of indices |
| `ByNodePropertyNodeSet`  | A set of nodes defined by a query to the 3D backend to find nodes that matches one or more properties/attributes |
| `ByAssetNodeSet`         | A set of nodes defined by [asset mappings](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#tag/3D-Asset-Mapping) linking 3D nodes to [assets](https://docs.cognite.com/dev/concepts/resource_types/assets.html) |
| `InvertedNodeSet`        | Inverts the result of a `NodeSet` to match the opposite nodes (i.e. a NOT-operator) |
| `CombinedNodeSet`        | Combines nodes from several `NodeSet` by applying set operations. Supported operations are [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)") and [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)). |

It's also possible [implement custom `NodeSet`](cad-styling-custom). This can be useful for specialized queries or to load
sets from custom data sources.

:::note
The API for styling nodes has changed substantially since Reveal 1.x and upgrading Reveal 
will require manual steps to implement styling.

## Examples

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" />

To play around with the different styling options, we can use `Cognite3DModel.setDefaultNodeAppearance`. 
A few example styles are shown below.

### Ghosted style

```js runnable
model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
```

### Highlighted

```js runnable
model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Highlighted);
```
### Outline and custom color

By creating custom styles you have a powerful tool to customize how the model looks.

```js runnable
model.setDefaultNodeAppearance({ outlineColor: NodeOutlineColor.Orange });
```

Note that `outlineColor` restricts the choice of color to a predefined set. This is
a restriction imposed to reduce storage space for outlines to only 3 bits. The choice
of colors are:
```js
enum NodeOutlineColor {
  NoOutline = 0,
  White = 1,
  Black = 2,
  Cyan = 3,
  Blue = 4,
  Purple = 5,
  Pink = 6,
  Orange = 7
}
```
