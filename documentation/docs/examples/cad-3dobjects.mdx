Sometimes it's useful to add custom content to the 3D scene to model data Reveal doesn't
support or to customize the 3D environment. Reveal supports this by using the
`Cognite3DViewer.addObject3D`-function which accepts [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) objects.

:::note
There are a few restrictions to the 3D content that is to be combined with Reveal models:
- Reveal uses an "implicit lighting model", i.e. no lights are added to the scene. If you
need lights this needs to be added to the viewer scene.
- Geometry is expected to use "default depth testing", meaning
[`THREE.Material.depthTest`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material.depthTest) must be `true`,
[`THREE.Material.depthWrite`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material.depthWrite) must  `true` and
[`THREE.Material.depthFunc`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material.depthFunc) must be `LessEqualDepth`.
You might experience unexpected results if you are using materials where this doesn't hold.
- Objects with opacity less than 1.0 will appear transparent regardless of if
[`THREE.Material.transparent`](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=Material#api/en/materials/Material.transparent) is `true` or
`false`. The final composited image is always blended as if
[`THREE.Material.blendDst`](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=Material#api/en/materials/Material.blendDst) is
`OneMinusSrcAlphaFactor` and the blending settings on the material won't have any effect on the composition.

## Adding markers to the scene on clicks

The following example reacts to clicks in the scene and adds markers to the positions clicked.

```jsx runnable
const markerGeometry = new THREE.SphereBufferGeometry(1, 10, 10);
const markerMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  color: 'blue',
  transparent: true,
  opacity: 0.7
});
viewer.on('click', async event => {
  const intersection = await viewer.getIntersectionFromPixel(event.offsetX, event.offsetY);
  if (intersection) {
    const marker = new THREE.Mesh(markerGeometry, markerMaterial);
    marker.position.copy(intersection.point);
    viewer.addObject3D(marker);
  }
});
```

## Add environment

To make a model feel more natural it might be useful to add an environment. The following
example adds sky and a sea effect for the example oil rig.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('/img/cad-skyandocean.png')}
  alt="Oil rig with sky and ocean"
/>

Below you'll find [an interactive example](#interactive-example), but first lets walk through
the different parts.
See the bottom of this page for an interactive example.

First, let's encapsulate the model in a large sky-textured sphere to create an illusion of
skies. The sphere map is available from [Free HDR - EXR SKIES-blog](http://freepanorama.blogspot.com/).

```js
const modelCenterAtSeaLevel = model
  .getModelBoundingBox()
  .getCenter(new THREE.Vector3());
modelCenterAtSeaLevel.y = 0.0;

// Skybox
const skyBox = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.SphereBufferGeometry(3000, 15, 15),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
    side: THREE.BackSide,
    // Skybox texture from http://freepanorama.blogspot.com/2010/01/sky7-spherical.html
    map: new THREE.TextureLoader().load(skyUrl),
  })
);
skyBox.position.copy(modelCenterAtSeaLevel);
viewer.addObject3D(skyBox);
```

This looks a bit better, but the oil rig appears to be floating mid-air at this point. Lets
add an ocean. A plane is rendered at the sea level.

```js
// Water
const waterGeometry = new THREE.PlaneBufferGeometry(6000, 6000, 63, 63);

const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  map: new THREE.TextureLoader().load(
      'https://threejs.org/examples/textures/water.jpg',
      (texture) => {
      texture.wrapS = texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
    }),
  color: { value: new THREE.Color(0x0099ff)},
  side: THREE.DoubleSide
});

const water = new THREE.Mesh(waterGeometry, material);
// Make the ocean horizontal
water.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;
water.position.copy(modelCenterAtSeaLevel);
viewer.addObject3D(water);
```

### Interactive example

Below is the complete code for adding a skybox and ocean to the scene.

```jsx runnable
const modelCenterAtSeaLevel = model
  .getModelBoundingBox()
  .getCenter(new THREE.Vector3());
modelCenterAtSeaLevel.y = 0.0;

// Skybox
const skyBox = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.SphereBufferGeometry(3000, 15, 15),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
    side: THREE.BackSide,
    // Skybox texture from http://freepanorama.blogspot.com/2010/01/sky7-spherical.html
    map: new THREE.TextureLoader().load(skyUrl),
  })
);
skyBox.position.copy(modelCenterAtSeaLevel);
viewer.addObject3D(skyBox);

// Water
const waterGeometry = new THREE.PlaneBufferGeometry(6000, 6000, 63, 63);

const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  map: new THREE.TextureLoader().load(
      'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Water_texture_1390894_Nevit.jpg/2048px-Water_texture_1390894_Nevit.jpg',
      (texture) => {
      texture.wrapS = texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
    }),
  color: { value: new THREE.Color(0x0099ff)},
  side: THREE.DoubleSide
});

const water = new THREE.Mesh(waterGeometry, material);
// Make the ocean horizontal
water.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;
water.position.copy(modelCenterAtSeaLevel);
viewer.addObject3D(water);

// Restrict camera movement
const boundingSphere = new THREE.Sphere(modelCenterAtSeaLevel, 2000);
viewer.on('cameraChange', (position, target) => {
  // Keep camera above sea level
  if (position.y < 20) {
    position.y = 21;
    viewer.setCameraPosition(position);
  }
  // Clamp point within our skybox to avoid moving outside the defined 'world'
  if (!boundingSphere.containsPoint(position)) {
    boundingSphere.clampPoint(position, position);
    viewer.setCameraPosition(position);
  }
});

//Make sure the Skybox & ocean plane have applied textures
setTimeout(() => {
  viewer.requestRedraw();
}, 100);

```
