## E2E Testing

Read [Setup](https://github.com/cognitedata/fusion#setup-1) for setup the credentials.

### Run the tests

To run the platypus e2e tests from the terminal using a headless browser, make sure the [mock server is running](https://github.com/cognitedata/fusion#run-the-tests), and then from another terminal window, run:

`nx run interactive-diagrams:e2e`

To run them in the Cypress GUI:

`nx run interactive-diagrams:e2e --watch`

You can optionally run the e2e tests using the `Nx Console` VSCode extension by clicking to run `e2e` and then choosing the `interactive-diagrams` project.
