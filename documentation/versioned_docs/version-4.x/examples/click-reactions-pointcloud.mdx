description: Detecting intersections from clicks in point cloud models
---

While point clouds doesn't have a concept of nodes, applications can detect clicked points. Just like with
CAD models, `Cognite3DViewer.getIntersectionFromPixel` is used to determine world position and point from
a mouse click.

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/versioned_docs/version-4.x/components/DemoWrapper';

<DemoWrapper modelType="pointcloud" />

## Detecting clicked positions

The following example detects intersections at clicked positions and marks the intersected positions
using a red sphere.

```js runnable-4x
viewer.on('click', async event => {
  const intersection = await viewer.getIntersectionFromPixel(
    event.offsetX, event.offsetY
  );
  if (intersection) {
    const sphere = new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.1),
      new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ wireframe: true, color: 'red' }));
    sphere.position.copy(intersection.point);
    viewer.addObject3D(sphere);
  };
});
```

## Getting information about object assigned to a clicked point
Using Cognite's Annotations API, a user can define objects within a point cloud model.
In order to retrieve information about a clicked object, users may get the `annotationId` or the `assetRef` that is assigned to each point.
The `annotationId` and `assetRef` are available in the `intersection` object returned from `viewer.getIntersectionFromPixel`.
An annotation id of 0 means that the clicked point is not assigned to any object. `assetRef` will only be defined if the annotation associated with the point is linked to an asset in CDF. The objects in this point cloud example have no assets associated to them.

```js runnable-4x
viewer.on('click', async event => {
  const intersection = await viewer.getIntersectionFromPixel(
    event.offsetX, event.offsetY
  );
  if (intersection) {
     alert(`Clicked object with annotationId ${intersection.annotationId} and assetId ${intersection.assetRef?.id}`);
  };
});
```
