description: Usage of the styling API for pointcloud models

Cognite Data Fusion has a concept of "objects" in point clouds, represented by one or more bounding volumes for
each object. The objects are backed by the [CDF Annotations API](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#tag/Annotations).
Reveal supports styling individual objects within a point cloud.

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/versioned_docs/version-4.x/components/DemoWrapper';

<DemoWrapper modelType="pointcloud" />

In this context, a _stylable object_ is represented by a volume in space. Styling an object results in all points that lie within the corresponding volume to attain the assigned style.

Stylable objects must be supplied separately from the model itself. Upon adding a new point cloud model to the viewer, Reveal will automatically fetch data describing the point cloud objects from CDF's Annotations API, if any are available. To get the number of fetched stylable objects, use the property `model.stylableObjectCount`, where `model` is a `CognitePointCloudModel`.

After the model and associated stylable objects are loaded, you may list the objects using `model.traverseStylableObjects`. This method traverses all objects as instances of `PointCloudObjectMetadata`, containing the following fields:

| Field                      | Field type                      | Description                                                                           |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `annotationId`             | `number`                        | The ID of the CDF annotation that this stylable object corresponds to.                |
| `assetId`                  | `number?`                       | The ID of the CDF asset associated with the annotation, if any.                       |
| `boundingBox`              | `THREE.Box3`                    | The bounding box of the stylable object in Reveal space.                              |

To visualize all bounding boxes associated with the stylable objects:

```js runnable
const boxGroup = new THREE.Group();

model.traverseStylableObjects(obj => boxGroup.add(new THREE.Box3Helper(obj.boundingBox)));

viewer.addObject3D(boxGroup);
```

Point cloud objects can be styled with a `PointCloudAppearance` object, containing the following attributes:

| Field                      | Field type                      | Description                                                                           |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `color`                    | `[number, number, number]?`     | Override color by setting RGB values in range [0,255]. `[0, 0, 0]` means no override. |
| `visible`                  | `boolean?`                      | When false, stylable object will be invisible. Default value is `true`.               |

To assign a style to one or more stylable objects, you must first create an instance of the abstract class `PointCloudObjectCollection`. Currently, the only implementation of this class provided by Reveal is `AnnotationIdPointCloudObjectCollection`, which is initialized with a list of annotation IDs corresponding to stylable objects. To see all available annotation IDs associated with the model, you may use the method `model.traverseStylableObjects`.

To color all stylable objects green:

```js runnable
const annotationIds = [];

model.traverseStylableObjects(objectMetadata => annotationIds.push(objectMetadata.annotationId));

const objectCollection = new AnnotationIdPointCloudObjectCollection(annotationIds);
const appearance = { color: [0, 255, 0] };

model.assignStyledObjectCollection(objectCollection, appearance);
```

After assigning style to an object collection, you may use the property `model.styledCollections` to get a list of all object collections and their assigned styles registered on the model.

## Default appearance

It is also possible to set a default appearance for the point cloud using the `model.setDefaultPointCloudAppearance`. The following example makes all annotated objects visible, while hiding everything else:

```js runnable
const annotationIds = [];

model.traverseStylableObjects(annotationMetadata => annotationIds.push(annotationMetadata.annotationId));

const objectCollection = new AnnotationIdPointCloudObjectCollection(annotationIds);
const appearance = { visible: true };

model.assignStyledObjectCollection(objectCollection, appearance);
model.setDefaultPointCloudAppearance({ visible: false });
```

Like in CAD styling, stylable objects that are part of multiple styled object collections will attain the appearance of the object set whose first style assignment was last.

## Unassigning styled object collections

To reset style of an object collection, use `model.unassignStyledObjectCollection` with the previously styled `PointCloudObjectCollection` as argument. To reset all styled objects use `model.removeAllStyledCollections`

## Reset all styled object collections

To reset all styled object collections, use the method `model.removeAllStyledObjectCollections()`.

This example removes all style on stylable object collections and makes sure the rest of the point cloud is visible.
```js runnable
model.removeAllStyledObjectCollections();
model.setDefaultPointCloudAppearance({ visible: true });
```
