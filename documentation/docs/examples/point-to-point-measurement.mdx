description: Demo shows how to measure point to point distance in Reveal.

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/docs/components/DemoWrapper';

The `MeasurementTool` is a measuring tool for point to point distance with the 3D objects.
This can be achieved by selecting a point on the 3D Object and drag the pointer to the destined point to get measurement of the distance.
The tool default measures in "Meters" as supported in Reveal, but the user can choose options to measure distance in "Feet", "Inches" & Centimeter"
based on their convinience, the tool will calculate the measuring distance value respectively.

The tool provides ability to change measuring line width & color.

:::note
The tool supports only point to point measurement

## Point to point distance measurment
To add point to point measurement, use `MeasurementTool.addMeasurementDistance()` which will have default line width & color.

```jsx runnable
// import { MeasurementTool } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const measurement = new MeasurementTool(viewer);
measurement.addMeasurementDistance();
```

### Change width and color of the measuring line
To change width and color of the line, use `MeasurementTool.setLineOptions(lineOptions: MeasurementLineOptions)`. MeasurementLineOptions expects
  - `lineWidth` : number,
  - `color` : number

```jsx runnable
// import { MeasurementTool } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const lineOptions = {
  lineWidth: 0.004,
  color: 0xff0000
}
const measurement = new MeasurementTool(viewer);
measurement.addMeasurementDistance();
measurement.setLineOptions(lineOptions);
```

### Measure with different units
To change the units of measuring distance, the tool supports feet, inches and centimeters units other than the default meters. For changing to different
units, we can pass a callback as option to the tool with `MeasurementUnits`.
  - MeasurementUnits.Feet
  - MeasurementUnits.Inches
  - MeasurementUnits.Centimeter
  - MeasurementUnits.Meter

```jsx runnable
// import { MeasurementTool, MeasurementUnits } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const measurement = new MeasurementTool(viewer, {unitsUpdateCallback: () => { return MeasurementUnits.Feet}});
measurement.addMeasurementDistance();
```
