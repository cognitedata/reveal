360 images is a common way to augment the 3D experience of your application.
A 360 image is a controllable panoramic image that surrounds the original point from which the shot was taken. 
360 images simulate being in the shoes of a photographer and looking around to the left, right, up and down as desired as well as zooming.

The `Cognite3DViewer` entrypoint exposes the following methods related to 360 images.

```ts
add360ImageSet(
  datasource: 'events', 
  eventFilter: { [key: string]: string }, 
  add360ImageOptions?: AddImage360Options
): Promise<Image360Collection>;

remove360Images(...image360Entities: Image360[]): Promise<void>:

enter360Image(image360: Image360): Promise<void>:

exit360Image(): void
```

To visualize 360 images the data must have been previously ingested into [Cognite Data Fusion](https://www.cognite.com/en/product/cognite_data_fusion_industrial_dataops_platform).
More info on the ingestion process can be found [here](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/3d/guides/360images_upload/).

Once the data is ingested, a set of 360 images can be added to the viewer with `viewer.add360ImageSet(...)`.
`datasource` describes the source data type used for storing the 360 images.
At this time, the only valid `datasource` is `'events'`, but you can expect more to be added in the future.
The `eventFilter` property describes the filter that is used when fetching data from the data source.
This is a generic key-value pair and can point to any metdata that was set during ingestion.
`viewer.add360ImageSet(...)` will return a `Image360Collection` which contains each of the `image360` entities for this given set.
The definition of `Image360Collection` can be found [here.](../api/interfaces/cognite_reveal.Image360Collection)

The `AddImage360Options` is used for correcting / adding transformations to the set of 360 images. The declaration can be found [here.](../api/modules/cognite_reveal#addimage360options)

:::note
The 360 images should be ingested with proper transformation data, and one should only rely on `AddImage360Options` when failing to do so or when using the same 360 images for multiple 3D models with different coordinate system.
If you find that the data does not line up correctly, please try to update the source data instead adding the optional transformation.
:::

If the data is ingested similar to the guide referenced earlier, adding a set of 360 images can look like this:
```ts
viewer.add360ImageSet('events', { site_id: 'site-S01-area-a03' });
```

Once added to the viewer you will see a white circle representing each 360 image, here is an example of what it can look like:
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/image360_1.png')} alt="AxisViewTool" />

Once the 360 images have been added, the icons are clickable, and when clicked, will enter the 360 image.
Reveal provides navigation using mouse or touch and transition effects when clicking another 360 image.
It is also possible enter a 360 image programmatically by calling the `enter360Image(image360: Image360)` method.
Exiting the visualization of a given 360 image is also possible using the `exit360Image()` method.
For convenience, this is bound to the `ESCAPE` key out of the box.

An example of entering into a 360 image can be seen here:
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/image360_2.png')} alt="AxisViewTool" />

To remove one or more 360 images you can use the `remove360Images(...)` method which will also cleanup icons and other related data to the instance.

The `Image360` declaration can be found here [here.](../api/interfaces/cognite_reveal.Image360)

The `transform` property from `Image360` represents the world transformation (rotation and translation) of the 360 image.
The `Image360Visualization` object has convenience functionality related to the visualization of the 360 image such as setting the opacity of the given 360 image.
  
## Events
The `Image360Collection` exposes events `image360Entered` and `image360Exited` for subscribing to enter & exit from 360 image mode.
Subscribing to the events can look like
```ts
const image360Collection = await viewer.add360ImageSet('events', { site_id: 'site-S01-area-a03' });
image360Collection.on('image360Entered', (image360: Image360) => {
    const position = new THREE.Vector3();
    position.setFromMatrixPosition(image360.transform);
    alert(`360 Image mode entered at Image position: ${JSON.stringify(position)}`);
  });
image360Collection.on('image360Exited', () => { alert('Exited from 360 Image mode'); });
```
