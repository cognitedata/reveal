          The BHP from Gauge BHP calculation estimates the Bottom Hole Pressure
          using the Tubing Performance Curve (also known as VLP curve or lift
          curve). PROSPER does not expose an explicit calculation command for
          this method, so an iterative numeric nonlinear solving routine is
          performed on top of PROSPER to enable the calculation. There are 5
          input variables required for the BHP from Gauge BHP: BHPg, THP, THT,
          CGR/GOR, and WGR/WC.
