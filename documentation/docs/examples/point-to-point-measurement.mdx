The `MeasurementTool` is a measuring tool for point to point distance with the 3D objects.
This can be achieved by selecting a point on the 3D Object and drag the pointer to the destined point to get measurement of the distance.
The tool default measures in "Meters" as supported in Reveal, but the user can choose options to measure distance in "Feet", "Inches" & Centimeter"
based on their convinience, the tool will calculate the measuring distance value respectively.

The tool provides ability to change measuring line width & color.

:::note
The tool supports only point to point measurement

## Point to point distance measurment
To add point to point measurement, use `MeasurementTool.add()` which will have default line width & color.

```jsx runnable
// import { MeasurementTool } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const measurement = new MeasurementTool(viewer);
measurement.add();
```
### Remove measurement
To remove point to point measurement, use `MeasurementTool.remove()`.

```jsx runnable
// import { MeasurementTool } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const measurement = new MeasurementTool(viewer);
measurement.add();
measurement.remove();
```

### Change width and color of the measuring line
To change width of the measuring line, use `MeasurementTool.updateLineWidth(lineWidth: number)`.

```jsx runnable
// import { MeasurementTool } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const measurement = new MeasurementTool(viewer);
measurement.add();
measurement.updateLineWidth(0.005);
```

To change color of the measuring line, use `MeasurementTool.updateLineColor(color: number)`.
```jsx runnable
// import { MeasurementTool } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const measurement = new MeasurementTool(viewer);
measurement.add();
measurement.updateLineColor(0x00ff00);
```

It's also possible to apply custom label content for the measurment.
The tool provides option of custom callback for the users. 'MeasurementOptions.transformMeasurementLabel` can be
used to trigger custom operation like change the measuring units to feet. 

```jsx runnable
// import { MeasurementTool, MeasurementUnits } from '@cognite/reveal/tools';

const measurement = new MeasurementTool(viewer, {transformMeasurementLabel: (distance: number) => {
      // 1 meters = 3.281 feet
      const distanceInFeet = distance * 3.281;
      return { distance: distanceInFeet, units: 'ft'};
     }});
measurement.add();
```
