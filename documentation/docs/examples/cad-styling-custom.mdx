import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/docs/components/DemoWrapper';

In many cases applications will need to filter 3D nodes by some custom data source or mechanism. This
is done by extending the `NodeCollection`-class. This class generates an `IndexSet` and
provides notification when the set has changed. Implementations should
be non-blocking - slow operations should be executed async and the set should
be incrementally updated to avoid blocking the viewer.

# Simple, static node collection

```js runnable
// import { NodeCollection, DefaultNodeAppearance, ClusteredAreaCollection } from '@cognite/reveal';

class MyNodeCollection extends NodeCollection {
  isLoading = false;

  constructor(model) {
    super('MyNodeCollection'); // Token for (de)serialization
    this._nodeCount = model.nodeCount;
    this._indexSet = new IndexSet();

    for (let i = 0; i < model.nodeCount; i += 100) {
      this._indexSet.add(i);
    }
  }

  getIndexSet() {
    return this._indexSet;
  }

  getAreas() {
    if (this._areas) {
      return this._areas;
    }

    const indices = this._indexSet.toIndexArray();

    // getBoundingBoxesForIndices() may use the SDK or a NodesApiClient to fetch
    // the bounding boxes of the relevant nodes
    const boxes = getBoundingBoxesForIndices(indices);

    this._areas = new ClusteredAreaCollection();
    this._areas.addAreas(boxes);

    return this._areas;
  }

  clear() {
    this._indexSet.clear();
    this.notifyChanged();
  }
}

const myNodes = new MyNodeCollection(model);
model.setDefaultNodeAppearance(DefaultNodeAppearance.Ghosted);
model.assignStyledNodeCollection(myNodes, { renderGhosted: false, color: new THREE.Color(0.15, 0.8, 0.08) } );
```

# Details about IndexSet

`IndexSet` is a specialized implementation of [`Set<number>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)
that is optimized for storing ranges of numbers. This is a common case for nodes as typically a
subtree will have the same styling applied.

Although `IndexSet` supports adding and removing individual elements using `add()` and `remove()`, the best
performance is achieved by using `addRange()` and `removeRange()` whenever possible.

Also note that changes to the underlying `IndexSet` held by a `NodeCollection` isn't automatically propagated
to be visible in the rendered result. In order to trigger an update after changing the underlying `IndexSet`,
use `NodeCollection.notifyChanged()` (protected function). Note that this function should not be triggered too often
as it might take some time to apply the changes.
