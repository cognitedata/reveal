# Cognite Data Exploration Package

This is the early documentation for using the Cognite Data Exploration Package. Simply add

```js
<DataExplorationProvider sdk={sdk}>...</DataExplorationProvider>
```

to your app and you will have access to the following abilities in any of the components under the `DataExplorationProvider`: **resource previewing** and **resource selection**

These are the props for `DataExplorationProvider`, only the SDK is necessary.

<ArgsTable of={DataExplorationProvider} />
