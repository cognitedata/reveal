Clipping planes, also called slicing planes, can be used to "cut through" the model to reveal the interior. This is
useful to isolate interesting parts of the model and hide obscuring geometry. Reveal supports having multiple clipping planes
in arbitrary position and orientation. When clipping planes are active,
the amount of geometry loaded might be reduced since culled geometry doesn't need
to be loaded (or rather loaded in a lower detail level).

## Examples

<DemoWrapper />

### Single, fixed clipping plane

Clipping planes are defined by providing zero or more [`THREE.Plane`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Plane)
to `Cognite3DViewer.setClippingPlanes`. The clipping planes are activated for all models and
replaces any active clipping planes.

Typically, [setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint)
is used to create clipping planes. This function accepts a direction that defines the orientation of
the plane and a point on the plane. For example, the following
code will create a clipping plane that only accepts geometry below `Y = 55`:

```jsx runnable
const orientation = new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0);
const point = new THREE.Vector3(0, 55, 0);
const plane = new THREE.Plane().setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, point);
viewer.setClippingPlanes([plane]);
```

### Animated clipping plane

Planes can be manipulated runtime and effects will have an effect in the viewer. Note however that rendering must be
triggered after updating the plane before the change will have a visual effect. This can be done using
`Cognite3DViewer.requestRedraw()` or simply set new planes using `Cognite3DViewer.setClippingPlanes`.

Below is an example animates a clipping plane by ping-ponging the plane in the vertical direction.

```js runnable
const bbox = model.getModelBoundingBox();

const orientation = new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0);
const point = new THREE.Vector3(0, bbox.max.y, 0);
const plane = new THREE.Plane();
plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, point);
viewer.setClippingPlanes([plane]);

const start = performance.now();
setInterval(() => {
  // Ping-pong plane between top of model and half-way to the bottom
  const dt = (performance.now() - start) / 1000.0
  const s = 0.5 * (Math.sin(Math.PI * dt / 10.0) + 1.0);
  point.y = bbox.max.y - (bbox.max.y - bbox.min.y) / 2.0 * s;
  plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, point);

  viewer.requestRedraw();
}, 1000 / 60);
```

:::note
Updating `THREE.Plane`-instances will not trigger data loading. To manually trigger data loading after doing
substantial changes to the clipping planes, use `Cognite3DViewer.setClippingPlanes`. Note that the example
above performs substantial changes to the planes without loading data. In a real application it's recommended
to not load data during animation, but initiate data after an animation is completed.

### Interactable clipping planes

Often it's required to have interactive clipping planes that the user can modify. The following example
show how [ThreeJS DragControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/DragControls) can be used
to manipulate the clipping planes.

After running this snippet the clipping plane can be manipulated by dragging the white manipulator.

```js runnable
// import { DragControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/DragControls';

const bounds = model.getModelBoundingBox();

// Create draggable sphere at the center of bounds
const initialDragPosition = new THREE.Vector3(bounds.min.x, 0.5*(bounds.max.y + bounds.min.y), bounds.min.z);
const draggerGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(5);
const draggerMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 'white' });
const draggerMesh = new THREE.Mesh(draggerGeometry, draggerMaterial);
draggerMesh.position.copy(initialDragPosition);
viewer.addObject3D(draggerMesh);

// Prepare a clipping plane
const orientation = new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0);
const plane = new THREE.Plane();
plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, initialDragPosition);
viewer.setClippingPlanes([plane]);


// Handle drag events
const controls = new DragControls([draggerMesh], viewer.cameraManager.getCamera(), viewer.domElement);
controls.addEventListener('drag', () => {
  // Fix XZ-poistion
  draggerMesh.position.set(initialDragPosition.x, draggerMesh.position.y, initialDragPosition.z);
  draggerMesh.updateWorldMatrix();
  // Update clipping plane
  plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0), draggerMesh.position);
  viewer.requestRedraw();
});

// When we are hovering over a sphere we want to disable viewer controls
controls.addEventListener('hoveron', () => {
  viewer.cameraManager.cameraControlsEnabled = false;
  draggerMaterial.color.set('gray');
  viewer.requestRedraw();
});

// And turn them back on when we stop hovering over it
controls.addEventListener('hoveroff', () => {
  viewer.cameraManager.cameraControlsEnabled = true;
  draggerMaterial.color.set('white');
  viewer.requestRedraw();
});
```

### CAD geometry filter

A special type of clipping is to provide a "geometry filter" when loading the model. A geometry filter restricts the
area to load geometry for and is specified when the model is created. Geometry filters not only hides clipped geometry,
it unloads unnecessary geometry to save memory and improve rendering performance.

```js
const min = new THREE.Vector3(10, 20, 30);
const max = new THREE.Vector3(20, 30, 40);
viewer.addModel({
  modelId,
  revisionId,
  geometryFilter: {
    boundingBox: new THREE.Box3(min, max)
  }
});
```

:::note
Geometry filters are static and cannot be changed after creating the model. Instead, remove and re-add the model,
or use regular clipping planes if they change frequently.
