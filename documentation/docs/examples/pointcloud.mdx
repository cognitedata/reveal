description: Usage of pointcloud models with Cognite3DViewer
---

`@cognite/reveal` supports point clouds through a third-party library, [`potree-core`](https://github.com/tentone/potree-core). The viewer 
supports loading both point clouds and CAD models at the same time. Point clouds can be generated from various sources including 
[laser scans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_scanning) and [photogrammetry models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry).
Loading point clouds is done with identical code to when [loading CAD models](./cad-basic) - Reveal will determine that the model 
is a point cloud model and act accordingly.

import { DemoWrapper } from '@site/src/components/DemoWrapper';

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" modelType="pointcloud" />

```jsx
import { CogniteClient } from '@cognite/sdk';
import { Cognite3DViewer } from '@cognite/reveal';

const client = new CogniteClient({
  appId: 'cognite.reveal.docs.Cognite3DViewer',
});

// to view models from CDF authentication is required
client.loginWithOAuth({ project: 'publicdata' });

// some div in your html page for Cognite3DViewer to insert a canvas
const domElement = document.getElementById('canvas-wrapper');

async function main() {
  const viewer = new Cognite3DViewer({ sdk: client, domElement });

  // load a model and add it on 3d scene
  // https://console.cognitedata.com/publicdata/3d-models/4715379429968321/revisions/5688854005909501
  const model = await viewer.addModel({
    modelId: 4715379429968321,
    revisionId: 5688854005909501,
  });
  viewer.loadCameraFromModel(model);

  // call viewer.dispose() when you don't need the viewer anymore
}
main();
```
