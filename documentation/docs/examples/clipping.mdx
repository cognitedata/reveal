describe: Reveal support adding a number of slicing planes to "cut through" the models.

Slicing planes, also called clipping planes, can be used to "cut through" the model to reveal the interior. This is 
useful to isolate interesting parts of the model and hide obscuring geometry. Reveal supports having multiple slicing planes
in arbitrary position and orientation. When slicing planes are active,
the amount of geometry loaded might be reduced since culled geometry doesn't need
to be loaded (or rather loaded in a lower detail level).

Slicing planes are currently not supported by point cloud models.

## Examples

<DemoWrapper name="Cognite3DViewerDemo" />

### Single, fixed slicing plane

Slicing planes are defined by providing zero or more [`THREE.Plane`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Plane) 
to `Cognite3DViewer.setSlicingPlanes`. The slicing planes are activated for all models and
replaces any active slicing planes.

Typically, [setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint)
is used to create slicing planes. This function accepts a direction that defines the orientation of
the plane and a point on the plane. For example, the following
code will create a slicing plane that only accepts geometry below `Y = 55`:

```jsx runnable
const orientation = new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0);
const point = new THREE.Vector3(0, 55, 0);
const plane = new THREE.Plane().setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, point);
viewer.setSlicingPlanes([plane]);
```

### Animated slicing plane

Planes can be manipulated runtime and effects will have an effect in the viewer. Note however that rendering must be 
triggered after updating the plane before the change will have a visual effect. This can be done using 
`Cognite3DViewer.forceRerender()`.

Below is an example animates a slicing plane by ping-ponging the plane in the vertical direction.

```js runnable
const bbox = model.getModelBoundingBox();

const orientation = new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0);
const point = new THREE.Vector3(0, bbox.max.y, 0);
const plane = new THREE.Plane();
plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, point);
viewer.setSlicingPlanes([plane]);

const start = performance.now();
setInterval(() => {
  // Ping-pong plane between top of model and half-way to the bottom
  const dt = (performance.now() - start) / 1000.0
  const s = 0.5 * (Math.sin(Math.PI * dt / 10.0) + 1.0);
  point.y = bbox.max.y - (bbox.max.y - bbox.min.y) / 2.0 * s;
  plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, point);

  viewer.forceRerender();
}, 1000 / 60);
```

:::note
Updating `THREE.Plane`-instances will not trigger data loading. To manually trigger data loading after doing 
substantial changes to the slicing planes, use `Cognite3DViewer.setSlicingPlanes`. Note that the example
above performs substantial changes to the planes without loading data. In a real application it's recommended 
to not load data during animation, but initiate data after an animation is completed.

### Interactable slicing planes

Often it's required to have interactive slicing planes that the user can modify. The following example 
show how [ThreeJS DragControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/DragControls) can be used 
to manipulate the slicing planes.

After running this snippet the slicing plane can be manipulated by dragging the white manipulator.

```js runnable
// import { DragControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/DragControls';

const bounds = model.getModelBoundingBox();

// Create draggable cone at center of bounds
const initialDragPosition = new THREE.Vector3(bounds.min.x, 0.5*(bounds.max.y + bounds.min.y), bounds.min.z);
const draggerGeometry = new THREE.SphereBufferGeometry(5);
const draggerMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 'white' });
const draggerMesh = new THREE.Mesh(draggerGeometry, draggerMaterial);
draggerMesh.position.copy(initialDragPosition);
viewer.addObject3D(draggerMesh);

// Prepare a slicing plane
const orientation = new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0);
const plane = new THREE.Plane();
plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(orientation, initialDragPosition);
viewer.setSlicingPlanes([plane]);

// Handle drag events
const controls = new DragControls([draggerMesh], viewer.getCamera(), viewer.domElement);
controls.addEventListener('drag', () => {
  // Fix XZ-poistion
  draggerMesh.position.set(initialDragPosition.x, draggerMesh.position.y, initialDragPosition.z);
  // Update slicing plane
  plane.setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0), draggerMesh.position);
  viewer.forceRerender();
});
controls.addEventListener('dragstart', () => {
  draggerMaterial.color = new THREE.Color('gray');
  viewer.cameraControlsEnabled = false;
});
controls.addEventListener('dragend', () => {
  draggerMaterial.color = new THREE.Color('white');
  viewer.cameraControlsEnabled = true;
});
```

### CAD geometry filter

A special type of slicing is to provide a "geometry filter" when loading the model. A geometry filter restricts the 
area to load geometry for and is specified when the model is created.

```js 
const min = new THREE.Vector3(10, 20, 30);
const max = new THREE.Vector3(20, 30, 40);
viewer.addModel({
  modelId, 
  revisionId, 
  geometryFilter: { 
    boundingBox: new THREE.Box3(min, max)
  }
});
```

:::note
Geometry filters are static and cannot be changed after creating the model.
